However, patients eventually progress on treatment, highlighting the need for additional therapies. We focused on pancreatic NETs (pNETs) and reasoned that treatment of these tumors upon progression on rapalog therapy, with an mTOR kinase inhibitor (mTORKi) such as CC-223 could overcome a number of resistance mechanisms in tumors and delay cardiac carcinoid disease. We performed preclinical studies using human pNET cells in vitro and injected them subcutaneously or orthotopically to determine tumor progression and cardiac function in mice treated with either rapamycin alone or switched to CC-223 upon progression. Detailed signaling and RNA sequencing analyses were performed on tumors that were sensitive or progressed on mTOR treatment. Approximately 57% of mice bearing pNET tumors which progressed on rapalog therapy showed a significant decrease in tumor volume upon a switch to CC-223. Moreover, mice treated with an mTORKi exhibited decreased cardiac dilation and thickening of heart valves than those treated with placebo or rapamycin alone. In conclusion, in the majority of pNETs that progress on rapalogs, it is possible to reduce disease progression using an mTORKi, such as CC-223. Moreover, CC-223 had an additional transient cardiac benefit on valvular fibrosis compared to placebo- or rapalog-treated mice. These results provide the preclinical rationale to further develop mTORKi clinically upon progression on rapalog therapy and to further test their long term cardioprotective benefit in those NET patients prone to carcinoid syndrome.",GSE102246,27,15433,28864682

Here, we genotyped 64 PanNETs for mutations in ATRX, DAXX, and MEN1 and found 37 tumors (58%) carry mutations in these three genes (A-D-M mutant PanNETs) and this correlates with a worse clinical outcome than tumors carrying the wild-type alleles of all three genes (A-D-M WT PanNETs). We performed RNA sequencing and DNA-methylation analysis on 33 randomly selected cases to reveal two distinct subgroups with one group consisting entirely of A-D-M mutant PanNETs. Two biomarkers differentiating A-D-M mutant from A-D-M WT PanNETs were high ARX gene expression and low PDX1 gene expression with PDX1 promoter hyper-methylation in the A-D-M mutant PanNETs. Moreover, A-D-M mutant PanNETs had a gene expression signature related to that of alpha cells (pval < 0.009) of pancreatic islets including increased expression of HNF1A and its transcriptional target genes.

The gene pairs involved in RNA-DNA interactions in these normal cells exhibited strong overlap with those with cancer-derived fusion transcripts. These data suggest an RNA-poise model, where the spatial proximity of one gene’s transcripts and the other gene’s genomic sequence poises for the creation of fusion transcripts.

We analyzed melanoma cells with acquired resistance to the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib, and demonstrated that palbociclib-mediated inhibition of PRMT5 is essential for sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibitors. Mechanistically, by inhibiting PRMT5 activity, palbociclib alters MDM4 pre-mRNA splicing leading to decreased MDM4 protein expression and subsequent p53 activation. In turn, p53 increases p21 leading to inhibition of CDK2, the main kinase substituting for CDK4/6 and a key driver of resistance to palbociclib. Loss of the ability of palbociclib to regulate the PRMT5-MDM4 axis leads to resistance. Importantly, combining palbociclib with the PRMT5 inhibitor GSK3326595 enhances the efficacy of palbociclib in treatment naïve and resistant models and also delays the emergence of resistance. Our studies have uncovered a novel mechanism of action of CDK4/6 inhibitors in regulating the MDM4 oncogene and the tumor suppressor, p53. Furthermore, we have established that palbociclib inhibition of the PRMT5-MDM4 axis is essential for robust melanoma cell sensitivity and provide pre-clinical evidence that co-inhibition of CDK4/6 and PRMT5 is an effective and well tolerated therapeutic strategy.

Loss of the ability of palbociclib to regulate the PRMT5-MDM4 axis leads to resistance. Importantly, combining palbociclib with the PRMT5 inhibitor GSK3326595 enhances the efficacy of palbociclib in treatment naïve and resistant models and also delays the emergence of resistance. Our studies have uncovered a novel mechanism of action of CDK4/6 inhibitors in regulating the MDM4 oncogene and the tumor suppressor, p53. Furthermore, we have established that palbociclib inhibition of the PRMT5-MDM4 axis is essential for robust melanoma cell sensitivity and provide pre-clinical evidence that co-inhibition of CDK4/6 and PRMT5 is an effective and well tolerated therapeutic strategy. Overall our data provides a strong rationale for further investigation of novel combinations of CDK4/6 and PRMT5 inhibitors in not only melanoma but other tumour types including breast, pancreatic and esophageal carcinoma.",GSE133568,6,18573,31439820

Cell division correlates also with genomic demethylation involving methylation loss in late-replicating partial methylation domains. Here we find that immunomodulatory pathway genes are concentrated in these domains and transcriptionally repressed in demethylated tumours with CpG island promoter hypermethylation. Global methylation loss correlated with immune evasion signatures independently of mutation burden and aneuploidy. Methylome data of our cohort (n = 60) and a published cohort (n = 81) in lung cancer and a melanoma cohort (n = 40) consistently demonstrated that genomic methylation alterations counteract the contribution of high mutation burden and increase immunotherapeutic resistance. Higher predictive power was observed for methylation loss than mutation burden. We also found that genomic hypomethylation correlates with the immune escape signatures of aneuploid tumours.

Efforts to define cellular populations associated with PD-1 clinical efficacy have been largely restricted to analysis of tumor material and the description of subsets of relevant cellular-based biomarkers in the blood of PD-1 inhibitor treated cancer patients are yet to be characterized. Given the particular expression pattern of PD-1 and TIGIT inhibitory receptors on peripheral CD8 T-cell subsets and the reported importance of CD8 T cells co-expressing these two markers for anti-PD-1 efficacy, we sought to determine the distinct biological features of peripheral CD8 subsets delineated based on PD-1 and TIGIT expression. Our findings identify the PD-1+TIGIT+ (DPOS) CD8+ T-cell population as a subset of highly activated and proliferating T cells, enriched in tumor-specific T-cell clones and overexpressing CXCR5, a key marker of the recently described CD8 cytotoxic follicular T cell (Tfc) population. Strikingly, the frequency of DPOS T cells after 1 month of anti-PD-1 therapy was associated with clinical response in three independent cohorts of cancer patients treated with PD-1 inhibitor. Additionally, transcriptomic profiling of this subset described common features with the PD-1high CXCL13+ lymphocyte subset previously demonstrated in tumor infiltrates to be predictive of PD-1 blockade efficacy.

However, the different subpopulations of macrophages and their effects on the tumor microenvironment remain poorly understood. Here, we combine new and previously-published single-cell RNA-seq data from 86,279 single cells from a total of 63 gliomas to profile 17,774 individual macrophages. Unsupervised clustering revealed an anti-inflammatory subpopulation of macrophages characterized by expression of MARCO (macrophage receptor with collagenous structure), a gene which has not been previously well-characterized in gliomas. MARCO is almost exclusively expressed in macrophages of IDH1-wildtype GBM rather than IDH1-mutated GBM or lower-grade gliomas. Previous studies have implicated MARCO as an unfavorable marker in melanoma and non-small-cell lung cancer; here, we find that bulk MARCO expression is associated with worse prognosis in TCGA glioblastomas, and associates with the mesenchymal expression subtype. Our single-cell analysis shows that this previously-reported mesenchymal signature primarily arises from MARCO-expressing macrophages. These MARCO-expressing macrophages differentially over-express gene sets related to hypoxia and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and under-express gene sets related to inflammation and antigen presentation. We show evidence that MARCO-expressing macrophages are recruited from the blood (as opposed to being resident microglia), and paired single-cell analysis of tumor and myeloid cells demonstrate that this recruitment may be driven by known chemoattractant factors. Furthermore, MARCO expression is significantly altered over the course of treatment with PD1 checkpoint inhibitors.

Further examination of RNA-seq data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and the Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that HEPACAM2 was highly expressed only in SCLC relative to all other cancers. HEPACAM2 expression was greater in SCLC compared with matching normal tissue; and also compared with pulmonary carcinoids. Although endogenous HEPACAM2 could not be detected by western blotting SCLC cells, stable over-expression of FLAG-tagged HEPACAM2 in NSCLC cells allowed detection of a ~70 kDa protein that was reduced to ~50 kDa by tunicamycin treatment, indicating its modification by glycosylation. Biotin labelling experiments further demonstrated that HEPACAM2 was present on the cell surface. Interestingly, in vitro experiments showed that HEPACAM2 over-expressing cells demonstrated more rapid cell attachment and slower wound healing relative to parental controls. This result was supported by RNA-seq analyses that revealed significant changes in gene expression related to cell adhesion and migration pathways in HEPACAM2 over-expressing cells, however validation assays demonstrated increased, not decreased, MMP2 and MMP9 expression. Remarkably, stable CRISPR knockdown of endogenous HEPACAM2 had no significant effects by pathway analysis. Nevertheless, specific and high expression of HEPACAM2 in SCLC suggests that it plays a unique and important role in SCLC biology and whose cell surface location may provide an attractive therapeutic target for this cancer.",GSE149035,24,24676,39301750

Distinct SCLC molecular subtypes have been defined based on expression of lineage-related transcription factors: ASCL1, NEUROD1, POU2F3 or YAP1, but their origins remain unknown. We developed an in vitro model of MYC-driven SCLC tumor cell progression, and performed a time-series analysis of single-cell transcriptome profiling to reveal that MYC drives the dynamic evolution of SCLC subtypes. Analyses of these single-cell RNA seq data reveal that MYC promotes a temporal shift from an ASCL1-to-NEUROD1-to-YAP1+ state from a neuroendocrine cell of origin. MYC activates Notch signaling to dedifferentiate tumor cells to non-neuroendocrine fates. Additional single-cell RNA sequencing of 4RPM tumors reveal individual tumors to consist of cells at nearly every stage of RPM tumor evolution modeled in vitro. With the single-cell RNA sequencing of this human SCLC liver biopsy, along with IHC on a panel of 21 human biopsies, we show that human SCLC exhibits intratumoral SCLC subtype heterogeneity, suggesting this dynamic evolution occurs in patient tumors.

This suggests there is more heterogeneity in neutrophils than previously appreciated. To better understand and target neutrophil functions in cancer, we must dissect neutrophil heterogeneity and how it changes from health to disease. To this end, we employed single-cell transcriptome technology to profile immature neutrophils from bone marrow of healthy individuals. Intriguingly, we identified a new neutrophil subset that expresses several B cell markers, including CD79a/b, components of the B cell receptors and PAX5, a lineage-specific transcriptional factor. We termed this population the BNeut. Using flow cytometry, we found that BNeuts are confined to the bone marrow of healthy individuals but expand into the blood of melanoma patients at an early stage, suggesting BNeuts might be a biomarker for disease. Additionally, we find BNeuts in the mouse models of different cancer types, including breast and lung carcinoma. The BNeut appears and functions more similar to a neutrophil than a B cell. BNeuts possess a neutrophil-like transcriptional profile, large cytoplasm with segmented nucleus, and produce ROS and NETs. Using imaging, we show that the BNeuts are single cells co-expressing both CD66b and CD79b, and lack the B cell surface marker CD19. To understand why neutrophils might use a B cell program, we explored different B cell functions including antigen presentation, a function that is usually absent from neutrophils. We show BNeuts are excellent at phagocytosis, including uptake of tumor cells. Further, BNeuts have increased expression of antigen presentation-related genes compared to other neutrophils and can modulate CD4+ T cell responses. Together, we have identified a novel neutrophil subset expressing B cell markers that is preferentially expanded in the blood of melanoma patients and poised to control T cell responses during disease.",GSE154777,30,16791,38022639

Lung carcinoids are variably aggressive and mechanistically understudied neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs). Here, we identified and elucidated the function of a miR-375/yes-associated protein (YAP) axis in lung carcinoid (H727) cells. miR-375 and YAP are respectively high and low expressed in wild-type H727 cells. Following lentiviral CRISPR/Cas9-mediated miR-375 depletion, we identified distinct transcriptomic changes including dramatic YAP upregulation. Similarly, YAP overexpression resulted in distinct and partially overlapping transcriptomic changes, phenocopying the effects of miR-375 depletion in the same models as above. Pathways analysis and confirmatory real-time PCR studies of shared dysregulated targets indicate that this axis controls neuroendocrine related functions such as neural differentiation, exocytosis, and secretion. Taken together, we provide compelling evidence that a miR-375/YAP axis is a critical mediator of neuroendocrine differentiation and tumorigenesis in lung carcinoid cells.",GSE154872,12,21290,34001972

However, it is well known that some cases have a good prognosis including spontaneously regression. To precise such a different patient’s outcome, reported prognostic markers, e.g. Merkel cell polyoma virus infection or programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression, are still insufficient. Here we performed RNA sequencing to evaluate immune response and comprehensively estimate prognostic values of immunogenic factors in MCC.　 Experimental Design: We collected 90 specimens from 71 patients and 53 blood serum samples from 21 patients with MCC from 9 facilities. mRNA was extracted from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues. Analyses of next generation sequencing data, immunohistochemical staining and blood serum tests were performed. Results: Next generation sequencing revealed that MCC samples could be divided into two types. “immune active type” showed better clinical outcomes than “cell division type”. Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase (G6PD) was one of the most significantly up-regulated gene in “cell division type”. G6PD expression correlated with the presence or absence of lymph node or distant metastases during the course and negatively correlated with high or low of PD-L1 expression with the top significance in 395 genes both. Immunohistochemical staining of G6PD was also correlated with disease specific survival and showed less heterogeneity compared with PD-L1 expression. G6PD activity was measurable by the blood serum test and detection values significantly increased as the cancer stage progression and significantly decreased after treatment. Conclusion: G6PD expression was an immunohistochemically and serum-detectable prognostic marker and negatively correlated with immune activity including PD-L1 associate with the prediction of immunotherapy response.",GSE154938,41,22790,NA

Chromatin accessibility, TF footprinting, and H3K27ac-dependent DNA looping data were generated to identify 7,531 cell type-specific CREs across 15 normal human cell types. A co-enrichment framework nominated 838 cell type-specific, recurrent heterotypic DNA motif combinations (DMCs), which were functionally validated using massively parallel reporter assays. Compared to their normal counterparts, cancer cells induced DMCs linked to neoplasia-enabling processes that operate in normal cells while also engaging entirely new DMCs. These data identify a cis-regulatory combinatorial DNA motif lexicon for cell type-specific gene regulation in diverse normal and diseased human cells. Purpose: To identify a cis-regulatory combinatorial DNA motif lexicon mediating cell type-specific gene regulation in diverse normal and diseased human cells, matched RNA-seq, chromatin accessibility profiling via ATAC-seq, and enhancer-promoter looping via H3K27ac HiChIP was performed in 15 primary human cell types and 6 human cancer cell lines.

Constitutively activated NRAS induces the MAPK and AKT signaling pathways and leads to uncontrolled proliferation and cell growth, making it an attractive target for small molecule inhibition. Like all RAS-family proteins, it has proven difficult to identify small molecules that directly inhibit the protein. An alternative approach would involve targeting the NRAS mRNA. The 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) of the NRAS mRNA is reported to contain a G-quadruplex (G4) that regulates the translation of NRAS mRNA. Stabilizing the G4 structure in NRAS by small molecules could reduce NRAS protein expression in cancer cells by impacting translation. Here we report a novel class of small molecule that binds to the G4 structure located in the 5′ UTR of the NRAS mRNA. We used a small molecule microarray (SMM) screen to identify molecules that selectively bind to the NRAS-G4. Biophysical studies demonstrated that compound 18 binds reversibly to the NRAS-G4 structure with submicromolar affinity. A Luciferase based reporter assay indicated that 18 inhibits the translation of NRAS via stabilizing the NRAS-G4 in vitro but showed only moderate effects on the NRAS levels in cellulo. Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE), RT-PCR analysis on 14 different NRAS-expressing cell lines, coupled with analysis of publicly available CAGE seq experiments, revealed that predominant NRAS transcript does not possess the G4 structure. Further analysis of published rG4 and G4 sequencing data indicated the presence of G4 structure in the promoter region of NRAS gene (DNA) but not in the mRNA. Thus, although the NRAS transcript lacks a G4 in many cell lines the broader concept of targeting folded regions within 5’ UTRs to control translation remains a highly attractive strategy.",GSE191144,16,18573,37257453

We used the minimal gene regulatory network of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) to reprogram cancer cells into professional antigen- presenting cells (tumor-APCs). Enforced expression of the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3 (PIB) was sufficient to induce cDC1 phenotype in 36 cell lines derived from human and mouse hematological and solid tumors. Within 9 days of reprogramming, tumor-APCs acquired transcriptional and epigenetic programs associated with cDC1 cells. Reprogramming restored the expression of antigen presentation complexes and costimulatory molecules on the surface of tumor cells, allowing the presentation of endogenous tumor antigens on MHC-I, and facilitating targeted killing by CD8+ T cells. Functionally, tumor-APCs engulfed and processed proteins and dead cells, secreted inflammatory cytokines, and cross- presented antigens to naïve CD8+ T cells. Human primary tumor cells could also be reprogrammed to increase their capability to present antigen and to activate patient-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In addition to acquiring improved antigen presentation, tumor-APCs had impaired tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Injection of in vitro generated melanoma-derived tumor-APCs into subcutaneous melanoma tumors delayed tumor growth and increased survival in mice. Antitumor immunity elicited by tumor-APCs was synergistic with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Proteasomes further bear critical importance in tumor immunogenicity by regulating inflammatory signaling, promoting immune cell activation and playing a crucial role in antigen processing and presentation. Indeed, response to immunotherapy in melanoma patients has been recently linked to increased expression of immunoproteasomes, a specialized form of proteasomes that are upregulated under inflammatory conditions. Yet, the percentage of patients that respond to therapy remains low, and the underlying mechanisms driving resistance remain poorly understood. Further, comprehensive analysis of the role proteasomes play in the pathophysiology of cancer and as a modulator of anti-tumor immunity is remains lacking. Here, we show that proteasome complex composition varies across cancer types and can be used to stratify patient response to immunotherapy. Specifically, we found that the proteasome regulator PSME4 is upregulated in NSCLC and associated with poor prognosis. We show that PSME4 alters proteasome activity and antigen processing attenuating the antigenic diversity and presentation. Through exacting biochemical assays, proteasome profiling of patient-derived NSCLC samples, combined with scRNA-seq, immunopeptidomics and in vivo analyses we uncovered a novel mechanism of immune evasion mediated by PSME4, which promotes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and abrogates anti-tumor immunity.

Despite efforts to inhibit oncogenic kinases, such as BRAFV600E, tumor responses in patients can be heterogeneous and limited by drug resistance mechanisms. Here, we describe patient tumors that acquired COP1 or DET1 mutations after treatment with the BRAFV600E inhibi-tor vemurafenib. COP1 and DET1 constitute the substrate adaptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4COP1/DET1, which targets transcription factors, including ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5, for pro-teasomal degradation. MAPK-MEK-ERK signaling prevents CRL4COP1/DET1 from ubiquitinating ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5, but the mechanistic details are still being elucidated. We found that pa-tient mutations in COP1 or DET1 inactivated CRL4COP1/DET1 in melanoma cells, stabilized ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5, and conferred resistance to inhibitors of the MAPK pathway. ETV5, in partic-ular, enhanced cell survival and was found to promote the expression of the pro-survival gene BCL2A1. Indeed, the deletion of pro-survival BCL2A1 re-sensitized COP1 mutant cells to vemu-rafenib treatment. These observations indicate that the post-translational regulation of ETV5 by CRL4COP1/DET1 modulates transcriptional outputs in ERK-dependent cancers, and its inactivation contributes to therapeutic resistance",GSE203468,6,20301,40643496

Equally, it is not known whether melanoma growth and metastatic dissemination are supported by overlapping or distinct melanoma subpopulations. By combining mouse genetics, unbiased lineage tracing and quantitative modelling, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, we provide evidence of a hierarchical model of tumour growth that mirrors the cellular and molecular logic underlying embryonic neural crest cell fate specification and differentiation. Our findings indicate that tumorigenic competence is associated with a spatially localized perivascular niche environment, a phenotype acquired through a NOTCH3-dependent intercellular communication pathway established by endothelial cells. Consistent with a model in which only a fraction of melanoma cells is fated to fuel growth, temporal single-cell tracing of a population of melanoma cells harbouring a mesenchymal-like state revealed that these cells do not contribute to primary tumour growth but, instead, constitutes a pool of metastatic-initiating cells that can switch cell identity while disseminating to secondary organs. Our data provide a spatially and temporally resolved map of the diversity and trajectories of cancer cell states within the evolving melanoma ecosystem and suggest that the ability to support growth and metastasis are limited to distinct pools of melanoma cells. The observation that these phenotypic competencies can be dynamically acquired upon exposure to specific niche signals warrant the development of therapeutic strategies that interfere with the cancer cell reprogramming activity of such microenvironmental cues.",GSE207592,25,24676;28457;31136,NA

No therapeutic predictive biomarkers exist and representative preclinical models to study their biology are missing. Patient-derived (PD) tumoroids may enable fast ex vivo pharmacotyping and provide subsidiary biological information for more personalized therapy strategies in individual patients. Experimental Design: PD tumoroids were established from rare biobanked surgical resections of advanced high-grade GEP-NEN patients. Using targeted in vitro pharmacotyping and next-generation sequencing of patient samples and matching PD tumoroids, we profiled individual patients and compared treatment-induced molecular stress response and in vitro drug sensitivity to the clinical therapy response. Results: We demonstrate high success rates in culturing PD tumoroids of high-grade GEP-NENs within clinically meaningful timespans. PD tumoroids recapitulate biological key features of high-grade GEP-NEN and mimic clinical response to cisplatin and temozolomide in vitro. Moreover, investigating treatment-induced molecular stress responses in PD tumoroids in silico, we discovered and functionally validated Lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A) and interferon-beta (IFNB1) as two vulnerabilities that act synergistically in combination with cisplatin and may present novel therapeutic options in high-grade GEP-NENs. Conclusion: Patient-derived tumoroids from high-grade GEP-NENs represent a relevant model to screen drug sensitivities of individual patients within clinically relevant timespans and provide novel functional insights into drug-induced stress responses. Clinical patient response to standard-of-care chemotherapeutics matches with drug sensitivities of PD tumoroids.

Differential DNA methylation analysis at 61,043 PAX5 binding sites in enhancer and promoter elements was performed to detect differences between n=14 MCC tissues and n=91 various normal B-cell populations. RNA analysis revealed full-length PAX5 expression in MCC at the transcriptional level using both PAX5 transcription start sites. PAX5 protein expression was found in 40 of 41 MCCs and six out of seven MCC cell lines. DNA methylation array analysis revealed 1,084 hypermethylated loci of enhancer and promoter elements located in PAX5 binding sites in MCC. Of these, 702 loci were associated with 257 genes which are not expressed. The PAX5-associated regulatory elements of these 257 genes were enriched for interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) and SPi-proto-oncogene (SPI1) binding motifs. Neither IRF4 or SPI1 could be detected in MCC on a RNA or protein level. Thus, because of the absence of these transcription factors we conclude that full length PAX5 alone cannot induce B-cell differentiation.",GSE214947,15,18573,40034069

However, the mechanisms underlying these associations are largely unknown. We studied several tumor types to identify the source of EMT gene expression signals and to illuminate mechanisms of resistance to immuno-oncology treatment. Across tumor types, EMT-related gene expression was strongly associated with expression of stroma-related genes. Based on RNA sequencing of multiple patient-derived xenograft models, EMT-related gene expression was enriched in the stroma versus parenchyma. EMT-related markers were predominantly expressed by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), cells of mesenchymal origin which produce a variety of matrix proteins and growth factors. Scores derived from a 3-gene CAF transcriptional signature (COL1A1, COL1A2, COL3A1) were sufficient to reproduce association between EMT-related markers and disease prognosis. Our results suggest that CAFs are the primary source of EMT signaling and have potential roles as biomarkers and targets for immuno-oncology therapies.",GSE215307,375,11154,36810872

We hypothesized that their presence could also have an impact on TIL therapy response. To address this, we performed RNA-seq of FFPE samples from a cohort of patients that received TIL therapy. Melanoma tumors collected prior to TIL infusion were evaluated for immune content in 9 responders and 11 non-responders to TIL therapy. Our data demonstrate an increase in class-switched memory B-cells in responders compared with non-responders to TIL therapy. In the myeloid compartment, increased presence of dendritic cell populations (pDC, aDC, and iDC) and basophils was observed in responders to TIL therapy, as well as higher content of γδ T cells and effector memory CD8+ T cells (CD8+ Tem) in the T-cell compartment. Next, we assessed the TLS presence in the same cohort by a gene expression signature of 12 chemokines using principal component analysis. The responders showed a higher TLS score compared with the non-responder patients, suggesting that patients responding to TIL therapy had more TLS in their tumors than the non-responder patients. These observations indicate that, same as in the immune checkpoint inhibitors therapy response, presence of B-cells and TLS might have a positive impact in the clinical outcome to TIL therapy.",GSE217387,20,30173,40199608

Methods: CD4+ and CD8+ TIL from metastatic melanoma patients treated with TIL ACT were analyzed by RNA-seq (n=12) and ChIP-seq of acetylated histone 3 (n=19). Patients were grouped into “TIL high” and “TIL low” based on division at the median number of TIL infused. The number of TIL infused and CD4+ TIL frequency were correlated with overall survival (OS). Results: The number of TIL infused correlated with longer OS (R2=0.57, p=0.00076), and the percent of CD4+ infused was negatively correlated with the total number of TIL infused (R2=0.64, p=0.00047). RNA-seq analysis of CD4+ TIL showed increases in Th2/Th17/Treg transcripts and pathways in the TIL low group. ChIP-seq analysis of CD8+ TIL showed decreased acetylation in the TIL low group in genes upregulated during CD8+ activation. Conclusion: The numbers of TIL infused were associated with increased overall survival, while RNA-seq suggested that polarized CD4+ cells in the transferred TIL were associated with decreased overall expansion.

Here, using a drug screen targeting chromatin regulators in patient-derived 3D melanoma cell cultures, we discovered that PARP inhibitors are capable of restoring MAPKi sensitivity. This synergy was found to be independent of DNA damage repair pathways and was effective both in vitro and in vivo in patients-derived xenografts. Strikingly, through integrated transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenomic analysis, we discovered that PARPi induces lysosomal autophagy which was accompanied by enhanced mitochondrial lipid metabolism that, ultimately, increased antigen presentation and T-cell cytotoxicity. Moreover, we also found that PARP inhibitors regulated EMT-like phenotype switching by dampening the mesenchymal phenotype via transcriptomic and epigenetic rearrangements. This, in turn, redirected melanoma cells towards a proliferative and, thus, MAPKi-sensitive state.

In this study we sought to further understand the role(s) of this population of ectoenzyme expressing T-cells (Teee). Using RNA-sequencing and flow cytometry to evaluate Teee from the peripheral blood of metastatic melanoma patients, we found that Teee were proliferative, apoptotic, had exhaustion associated phenotypes, and had high expression of inhibitory molecules. Co-culture of patient Teee with autologous T-cells in vitro resulted in suppression of proliferation of the target T-cells. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets, we identified distinct clusters of cells with a Teee gene signature present in melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and bladder cancer patients’ tumors. Teee were not present in healthy bladder tissue. Using multispectral immunofluorescence of melanoma patient FFPE tumor samples, we were able to identify CD4+ T-cells co-expressing CD38 and CD39 in the tumor microenvironment, which preferentially associated with Ki67- CD8+ T-cells. Finally, we found that high baseline intra-tumor frequencies of cells with a Teee gene signature were associated with checkpoint immunotherapy resistance and poor overall survival in metastatic melanoma patients.

We used the minimal gene regulatory network of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) to reprogram cancer cells into professional antigen- presenting cells (tumor-APCs). Enforced expression of the transcription factors PU.1, IRF8, and BATF3 (PIB) was sufficient to induce cDC1 phenotype in 36 cell lines derived from human and mouse hematological and solid tumors. Within 9 days of reprogramming, tumor-APCs acquired transcriptional and epigenetic programs associated with cDC1 cells. Reprogramming restored the expression of antigen presentation complexes and costimulatory molecules on the surface of tumor cells, allowing the presentation of endogenous tumor antigens on MHC-I, and facilitating targeted killing by CD8+ T cells. Functionally, tumor-APCs engulfed and processed proteins and dead cells, secreted inflammatory cytokines, and cross- presented antigens to naïve CD8+ T cells. Human primary tumor cells could also be reprogrammed to increase their capability to present antigen and to activate patient-specific tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. In addition to acquiring improved antigen presentation, tumor-APCs had impaired tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Injection of in vitro generated melanoma-derived tumor-APCs into subcutaneous melanoma tumors delayed tumor growth and increased survival in mice. Antitumor immunity elicited by tumor-APCs was synergistic with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Previous studies have mainly focused on blocking the interaction of YAP with TEAD transcription factors. Here we took a different approach by interfering with the binding of YAP to the transcription factor B-MYB using MY-COMP, a fragment of B-MYB containing the YAP binding domain fused to a nuclear localization signal. We found that expression of MY-COMP inhibited the binding of B-MYB to YAP, resulting in growth defects, nuclear abnormalities and polyploidization in HeLa cells. Additionally, MY-COMP interfered with normal cell cycle progression of YAP-dependent uveal melanoma cells, but its effects were much weaker in YAP-independent cutaneous melanoma cell lines. MY-COMP antagonized the YAP-dependent expression of MMB-regulated cell cycle genes, providing an explanation for the observed phenotypes. We identified NIMA-related kinase (NEK2) as a candidate target downstream of YAP and B-MYB, contributing to the transformation of YAP-dependent uveal tumor cell lines. Overall, our findings suggest that targeting selected YAP-MMB regulated genes such as NEK2 or inhibiting the WW-domains of YAP to suppress YAP-regulated cell cycle genes could provide a novel mechanism to antagonize the pro-tumorigenic functions of YAP.",GSE227973,21,18573,38182898

Understanding minimal residual disease (MRD) mechanisms and the connection with dormancy-like traits may guide strategies to target drug-tolerant persister cells and optimize target therapies. Here, we studied the relationship between persister cell tolerance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors (BRAFi + MEKi) and expression of nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group F member 1 (NR2F1), which has been linked to tumor dormancy in the context of cutaneous melanoma. In previously published RNA-seq datasets, NR2F1 expression was enriched in melanoma samples following BRAF inhibitor and MEK inhibitor (BRAFi + MEKi) treatment compared to pre-treatment patient-matched samples. We also found that NR2F1 is highly expressed in the residual drug-tolerant cell state following BRAFi + MEKi treatment in patient-derived and cell line-derived melanoma xenografts. Additionally, xenografts overexpressing NR2F1 displayed higher tumor growth and poorer animal survival following BRAFi + MEKi treatment compared to control xenografts expressing basal levels of NR2F1. In vitro, NR2F1-overexpressing cells showed increased tumor proliferation and higher expression of cell cycle and survival-related proteins on targeted therapy, such as phosphorylation of both RB and S6K proteins. In addition, NR2F1, highly expressed in invasive melanoma cells, was sufficient to promote invasiveness following BRAFi + MEKi in 3D tumor spheroid assays. Furthermore, when compared to young mice, NR2F1 was overexpressed in tumor xenografts in an old microenvironment. The use of shRNA NR2F1 in older mice led to slower tumor growth and the highest survival in animals on BRAFi + MEKi treatment. We also tested a pharmacological approach to target drug-tolerant persister cells that overexpress NR2F1 on BRAFi + MEKi treatment. The inhibition of mTORC1 delayed NR2F1-overexpressing cell proliferation compared to non-NR2F1-overexpressing cells on targeted therapy. Altogether, our findings suggest that NR2F1 plays a role in the persistence of MRD in melanoma, indicating that targeting NR2F1 expression could improve targeted therapy outcomes in melanoma patients.",GSE228600,36,24676,40955663

RMC is refractory to targeted and immune therapy strategies used for other renal cell carcinomas. We have demonstrated that RMC is resistant to immune checkpoint inhibition despite harboring an inflamed tumor immune microenvironment. Hence, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to reverse this resistance. We discovered that CD8+ T cells under SCD condition exhibit altered genomic architecture and ferroptosis, which significantly impairs the anti-tumor immunity of effector T cells. These observations may underscore a fundamental mechanism behind the distinct resistance of RMC resistance to immune checkpoint therapies. By leveraging the use of both mouse SCD model and humanized mice phenotypically representing SCD/SCA, as well as primary CD8+ T cells isolated from patients with SCA, we identified that the SLC7A11 gene is transcriptionally downregulated in the CD8+ T cells of SCA donors via genomic architecture alteration. The reduced expression of SLC7A11 partially accounts for the ferroptosis observed in the CD8+ T cells of SCD disease, via impairing the cystine transportation and synthesis of Glutathione (GSH). Our findings also demonstrated that treatment using a hydrogen sulfide slow-releasing donor restored the expression of SLC7A11, antagonized the ferroptosis of CD8+ T cells under SCD/SDA condition and restored anti-tumor immunity in vivo. Hence, our research findings provide novel mechanistic insights into SCD and RMC and pave the way to develop innovative therapeutic strategies to sensitize RMC to immune therapies.",GSE231386,28,16791,40359940

Methods: A long-term retrospective follow-up (13.5 ± 5.5 years) study involving 159 meningiomas in NF2 patients was performed. We assessed their characteristics by performing immunohistochemistry (IHC), bulk-RNA sequencing, and copy number analysis. All variables of meningiomas in NF2 patients were compared with those of 189 sporadic NF2-altered meningiomas. Results: Most meningiomas in NF2 patients were stable, and the mean annual growth rate was 1.0 ± 1.8 cm3/yr. Twenty-eight meningiomas (17.6%) in 25 patients (43.1%) were resected during the follow-up period.

It is most often found in burn scars, but it can also occur in other types of wounds, including venous stasis ulcers, pressure sores, and vaccination sites. The most common histological type of Marjolin’s ulcers is squamous cell carcinoma, however basal cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, and sarcomas have also been reported. All parts of the body could potentially be affected yet the lower extremities are the anatomic sites most commonly involved. While SCCs commonly have a metastasis rate of 0.5 to 3.0 percent, those arising from burn scars metastasize at a rate in excess of 30 percent. The 5-year survival after a diagnosis of Marjolin’s ulcer was found to be 50 percent. The transformation to a malignancy can occur either chronically, over a period of more than 35 years, or occasionally within a year of the original injury. The exact mechanism of this transformation is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to chronic keratinocyte dysfunction during the healing process of severe burn wounds. Surgical excision is the main treatment for Marjolin's ulcer and provides the best chance of survival. In a previous study, we investigated the bulk transcriptional changes that lead to Marjolin's ulcer by comparing global gene expression changes between squamous cells present in a squamous cell carcinoma versus those present within Marjolin's ulcer (MU) (Sinha et. al. JBCR 2017). This imparted novel insights into mechanisms underlying divergent clinical features of these cutaneous cancers.

[RNAseq],"Interferon-gamma (IFNg) exerts potent growth inhibitory (antiproliferative/pro-apoptotic) effects on a wide range of tumors, including melanoma. While several terminal effectors of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis have been identified, a definitive account of the signaling pathway leading to these events is lacking. We set up a chemical genomics screen and a whole genome targeting CRISPR/Cas9 screen in a growth inhibition (GI)-sensitive patient-derived melanoma (PDM) cell line. Drug screening revealed that treatment with RAF and ERK inhibitors disrupted IFNg GI in PDM cells. For the CRISPR screen, the gene-level analysis showed that the magnitude of enrichment for guide RNAs targeting ERK2 in IFNg-treated cells was comparable to core IFNg signaling proteins like IFNGR2, JAK1, JAK2, and STAT1. We validated the involvement of ERK by detecting a sustained increase in phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK) levels following IFNg treatment. In live imaging experiments, we found that an ERK inhibitor (ERKi) blocks the induction of cell death in 17 of 23 (~74%) IFNg-sensitive PDM lines covering all the MAPK mutant and triple wildtype molecular subtypes. Through gene expression analysis, we found that IFNg-ERK signaling triggered the expression of stress response genes and subsequent upregulation of DR5 and NOXA, which were both critical for the induction of cell death. In summary, the IFNg-ERK signaling axis mediates cell death downstream of IFNg treatment in melanoma cells. Our results provide a new understanding of the IFNg-mediated GI pathway that will also be crucial to define mechanisms of GI resistance in tumor cells.",GSE235235,16,21290,37803324

At the single-cell level, these gene expression states can persist for different lengths of time which is a quantitative measurement referred to as gene expression memory. Because plasticity is not encoded by genetic changes, these cell states can be reversible, and therefore, are amenable to modulation by disrupting gene expression memory. However, we currently do not have robust methods to find the regulators of memory or to track state switching in plastic cell populations. Here, we developed a lineage tracing-based technique to quantify gene expression memory and to identify single cells as they undergo cell state transitions. Applied to human melanoma cells, we quantified long-lived fluctuations in gene expression that underlie resistance to targeted therapy. Further, we identified the PI3K and TGF-β pathways as modulators of these state dynamics. Applying the gene expression signatures derived from this technique, we find that these expression states are generalizable to in vivo models and present in scRNA-seq from patient tumors. Leveraging the PI3K and TGF-β pathways as dials on memory between plastic states, we propose a ""pretreatment"" model in which we first use a PI3K inhibitor to modulate the expression states of the cell population and then apply targeted therapy. This plasticity informed dosing scheme ultimately yields fewer resistant colonies than targeted therapy alone.

While much is known about the major pathways regulating the UPRER, the roles of endocrine cell type-specific, context-dependent, and time-dependent transcriptional changes are not well explored. To identify unique and shared responses to the UPRER across a subset of endocrine cell types, we tested representative lines for β-cells (insulin), α-cells (glucagon), δ-cells (somatostatin), X/A-cells (ghrelin), L-cells (glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1)), and thyrotropes (thyroid hormone and thyroglobulin).

Identifying pathways that may distinguish tumor-restricted Tregs is important, yet the transcriptional programs that control intratumoral Treg gene expression, and that are distinct from Tregs in healthy tissues, remain largely unknown. We profiled single-cell transcriptomes of CD4+ T cells in tumors and peripheral blood from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), in non-tumor tonsil tissues and in peripheral blood from healthy donors. We identified a subpopulation of activated Tregs expressing multiple tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) genes (TNFR+ Tregs) that is highly enriched in the tumor microenvironment (TME) compared with non-tumor tissue and the periphery. TNFR+ Tregs are associated with worse prognosis in HNSCC and across multiple solid tumor types. Mechanistically, the transcription factor BATF is a central component of a gene regulatory network that governs key aspects of TNFR+ Tregs. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated BATF knockout in human activated Tregs in conjunction with bulk RNA sequencing, immunophenotyping and in vitro functional assays, corroborated the central role of BATF in limiting excessive activation and promoting the survival of human activated Tregs. Finally, we identified a suite of surface molecules reflective of the BATF-driven transcriptional network on intratumoral Tregs in patients with HNSCC.

Across a range of cancer cell lines, SMARCA4/SMARCA2 inhibition resulted in lineage-specific changes in chromatin accessibility at binding sites for key transcription factors (TFs). In uveal melanoma (UM), BAF inhibition resulted in loss of enhancer occupancy of SOX10 and MITF, two essential TFs, leading to down-regulation of the melanocytic gene expression program.

This MMP-9-dependent H3NT proteolysis is critical for establishing active state of gene transcription during osteoclast differentiation and melanoma development. However, whether H3NT cleavage by MMP-9 plays a similar role in other cellular events has not been explored. Here we dissect the functional contribution of MMP-9-dependent H3NT clipping to colonic tumorigenesis by using a combination of genome-wide transcriptome data, ChIP/ChIPac-qPCR, CRISPR/dCas9 gene-targeting system, and in vivo xenograft models. We show that MMP-9 is overexpressed in colon cancer cells and catalyzes H3NT proteolysis to drive transcriptional activation of growth stimulatory genes. Our studies using knockdown and inhibition approaches clearly indicate that MMP-9 mediates transcriptional activation and promote colonic tumorigenesis in a manner dependent on its protease activity toward H3NT. Remarkably, artificial H3NT proteolysis at target gene promoters with dCAS9-MMP-9 is sufficient for establishing their transcriptional competence in colon cancer cells, underscoring the importance of MMP-9-dependent H3NT proteolysis per se in transactivation process. Our data establish new functions and mechanisms for MMP-9 in driving oncogenic transcription program in colon cancer through H3NT proteolysis and demonstrate how this epigenetic pathway can be exploited as a potential therapeutic target for cancer treatment.",GSE242924,6,11154,38600695

Tumor-intrinsic mechanisms of immune exclusion have been identified in many cancers but less studied in AM. Methods: We characterized clinically annotated tumors from patients diagnosed with AM at our institution in correlation with ICI response using whole transcriptome RNAseq, whole exome sequencing, CD8 immunohistochemistry, and multispectral immunofluorescence imaging. A defined interferon-γ-associated T cell-inflamed gene signature was used to categorize tumors into non-T cell-inflamed and T cell-inflamed phenotypes. In combination with AM tumors from two published studies, we systematically assessed the immune landscape of AM and detected differential gene expression and pathway activation in a non-T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment (TME). Two single-cell(sc) RNAseq AM cohorts and 11 bulk RNAseq cohorts of various tumor types were used for independent validation on pathways associated with lack of ICI response. In total, 892 specimens were included in this study. Results: 72.5% of AM tumors showed low expression of the T cell-inflamed gene signature, with 23.9% of total tumors categorized as the non-T cell-inflamed phenotype. Patients of low CD3 + CD8 + PD1 + intratumoral T cell density showed poor prognosis. We identified 11 oncogenic pathways significantly upregulated in non-T cell-inflamed relative to T cell-inflamed TME shared across all three acral cohorts (MYC, HGF, MITF, VEGF, EGFR, SP1, ERBB2, TFEB, SREBF1, SOX2, and CCND1). scRNAseq analysis revealed that tumor cell-expressing pathway scores were significantly higher in low vs high T cell-infiltrated AM tumors. We further demonstrated that the 11 pathways were enriched in ICI non-responders compared to responders across cancers, including acral melanoma, cutaneous melanoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Pathway activation was associated with low expression of interferon stimulated genes, suggesting suppression of antigen presentation. Across the 11 pathways, fatty acid synthase and CXCL8 were unifying downstream target molecules suggesting potential nodes for therapeutic intervention. Conclusions: A unique set of pathways is associated with immune exclusion and ICI resistance in AM. These data may inform immunotherapy combinations for immediate clinical translation.",GSE243238,20,18573,37857525

Mechanistically, nuclear acetyl-CoA synthetase 2 (ACSS2) colocalises with ALDH1A3 to bind glucose metabolic and neural crest stem cell gene loci and promote local acetyl-histone H3 modification dependent on ALDH1A3. Consistent with clinical observations that dedifferentiation into stem cell states confer poor prognosis in melanoma patients and mediate drug resistance, we found in a zebrafish melanoma model that targeting the ALDH1A3-high subpopulation with an ALDH1 suicide inhibitor delayed BRAF inhibitor drug-resistant relapse. Our work identifies ALDH1A3 as a master coordinator of acetaldehyde metabolites that directly regulates chromatin-based gene regulation, and which can be pharmacologically targeted to improve therapeutic outcomes.",GSE243840,6,21697,38963759

However, there is evidence that changing the lineage of cancer cells leads to a drastic reduction of their tumorigenic potential. Different approaches have been developed to change the phenotype of a cell from one lineage to another, a process called transdifferentiation. In this study, we investigated whether melanoma cells can be transdifferentiated into neurons and how that affects their properties and characteristics. For this reason, we ectopically overexpressed the neuron-specific transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2, Myt1L and NeuroD1 in melanoma cells. We could show that melanoma cells could be transdifferentiated into neuron-like cells that expressed neuronal markers and showed a neuron-like morphology. RNA sequencing and DNA methylation assay were used to further reveal the underlying mechanism. Moreover, the transdifferentiated cells had a significantly reduced tumorigenic and metastatic potential and were more sensitive to radiotherapy compared with their parental counterparts.

Despite a frequently benign course, aggressive behavior occurs for unexplained reasons, especially in functional PitNET. Tumor behavior is known to be under the influence of the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, the relationship between TME cells and aggressive tumor behavior has not been adequately explored in PitNET. We used single-cell RNA sequencing and other analyses to comparatively characterize the transcriptome of seven gonadotroph and three lactotroph PitNET and correlate it with clinical behavioral patterns. In our lactotroph PitNET samples, we detect a highly proliferative gene profile with significantly increased expression levels in tumors with aggressive behavioral patterns within a bulk RNA-seq cohort of 134 PitNET samples. We also report high intratumoral heterogeneity in both gonadotroph and lactotroph PitNET and detect gene expression programs belonging to epithelial, endocrine and immunological functional networks in both subtypes. Direct comparison of the lymphoid compartment of both subtypes reveals increased CD4+ T cell abundances in gonadotroph and increased CD4-/CD8- double negative T cell and natural killer T cell abundances in lactotroph PitNET. Also notable is the presence of proliferative lymphocytes, whose occurrence in the bulk RNA-seq cohort positively correlates with more aggressive tumor behavior. Increased CD8+ T cell and natural killer (NK) cell abundancies, however, correlate significantly with reduced aggressiveness indicating anti-tumoral effects. Our study expands the knowledge of the differences in cellular composition of functional and non-functional PitNET subtypes and lays the foundation for further studies on the influence of lymphoid cells on the variable aggressive behavior of PitNET. Regarding the treatment of drug-resistant lactotroph PitNET, proliferative lymphocytes, CD8+ T and NK cells could represent potentially valuable targets for the development of new cancer immunotherapies in the future.",GSE244101,10,30173,39548496

To better understand its mechanism of action, we compared transcriptomes of 6 cancer cell lines of varying origins before and after Dpep exposure. This revealed a context-dependent pattern of regulated genes that was unique to each line, but that exhibited a number of shared elements with other lines. This included upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes and tumor suppressors as well as enrichment of genes associated with responses to hypoxia and interferons. Downregulated transcripts included oncogenes and dependency genes and enriched genes associated with different phases of the cell cycle as well as with DNA repair. In each case, such changes have the potential to lie upstream of apoptotic cell death. We also detected regulation of unique as well as shared sets of transcription factors in each line, suggesting that Dpep may initiate a cascade of transcriptional responses that culminate in cancer cell death.

However, no efficient targeted therapy options are currently available for patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma. MEK inhibitors (MEKi) appear to display a moderate anti-tumor activity and also immunological effects in NRAS-mutant melanoma, providing an ideal backbone for combination treatments. In this study, the MEKi binimetinib, cobimetinib, and trametinib combined with the BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) encorafenib, vemurafenib, and dabrafenib were investigated for their ability to inhibit proliferation, induce apoptosis and alter the expression of immune modulatory molecules in sensitive NRAS-mutant melanoma cells using 2D and 3D cell culture models and transcriptome analyses. Furthermore, NRAS-mutant melanoma cells resistant to the three BRAFi/MEKi combinations were established to characterize the mechanisms contributing to their resistance. All BRAFi induced a stress response in the sensitive NRAS-mutant melanoma cells thereby significantly enhancing the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity of the MEKi analyzed. Furthermore, BRAFi/MEKi combinations upregulated immune relevant molecules, such as ICOS-L, components of antigen-presenting machinery and the “don’t eat me signal” molecule CD47 in the melanoma cells. The BRAFi/MEKi-resistant, NRAS-mutant melanoma cells counteracted the molecular and immunological effects of BRAFi/MEKi by upregulating downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway molecules, inhibiting apoptosis and promoting immune escape mechanisms.

Mechanistically, SMARCAL1 relieves endogenous DNA damage and suppresses cGAS-STING-dependent signaling during cancer cell growth. Simultaneously, it cooperates with the AP-1 family member JUN to maintain chromatin accessibility at a transcriptional regulatory element in the PD-L1 gene, thereby promoting PD-L1 expression in cancer cells. SMARCAL1 loss hinders the ability of tumor cells to induce PD-L1 in response to genomic instability, enhances anti-tumor immune responses and sensitizes tumors to immune checkpoint blockade in a mouse melanoma model. Collectively, these studies uncover SMARCAL1 as a promising target for cancer immunotherapy.",GSE245449,18,20301;16791,38301646

Given their important contribution to disease progression, mapping fibroblasts’ heterogeneity is critical to devise effective anti-cancer therapies. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) represent the most abundant cell population in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Whether CAF phenotypes are differently specified by PDAC cell lineages remains to be elucidated. Here, we reveal an important role for the MAPK signalling pathway in defining PDAC CAF phenotypes. We show that epithelial MAPK activity promotes the myofibroblastic differentiation of CAFs by sustaining the expression and secretion of TGF-β1. We integrate single-cell profiling of post-perturbation transcriptional responses from mouse models with cellular and spatial profiles of human tissues to define a MAPKhigh CAF (mapCAF) phenotype. We show that this phenotype associates with basal-like tumour cells and reduced frequency of CD8+ T cells. In addition to elevated MAPK activity, this mapCAF phenotype is characterized by TGF-b signalling, hypoxia responsive signatures, and immunoregulatory gene programs. Furthermore, the mapCAF signature is enriched in myofibroblastic CAFs from various cancer conditions and correlates with reduced response to immune checkpoint inhibition in melanoma Altogether, our data expand our knowledge on CAF phenotype heterogeneity and reveal a potential strategy for targeting of myofibroblastic CAFs in vivo.  ",GSE246457,37,19057;18573;30173,39627211

Deciphering the transcriptional mechanisms governing reversible phenotypic transitions between proliferative/differentiated and invasive/stem-like states is required. Expression of the ZEB1 transcription factor is frequently activated in melanoma, where it fosters adaptive resistance to targeted therapies. Here, we performed a genome-wide characterization of ZEB1 transcriptional targets, by combining ChIP-sequencing and RNA-sequencing, upon phenotype switching in melanoma models. We identified and validated ZEB1 binding peaks in the promoter of key lineage-specific genes crucial for melanoma cell identity. Mechanistically, ZEB1 negatively regulates SOX10-MITF dependent proliferative/melanocytic programs and positively regulates AP-1 driven invasive and stem-like programs. Comparative analyses with breast carcinoma cells revealed lineage-specific ZEB1 binding, leading to the design of a more reliable melanoma-specific ZEB1 regulon. We then developed single-cell spatial multiplexed analyses to characterize melanoma cell states intra-tumoral heterogeneity in human melanoma samples. Combined with scRNA-Seq analyses, our findings confirmed increased ZEB1 expression in Neural-Crest-like cells and mesenchymal cells, underscoring its significance in vivo in both populations. Overall, our results define ZEB1 as a major transcriptional regulator of cell states transitions and provide a better understanding of lineage-specific transcriptional programs sustaining intra-tumor heterogeneity in melanoma.",GSE246603,22,24676,38519642

In this work we used an in vitro model of LEC activation to trigger lymphangiogenesis using a mix of recombinant pro-lymphangiogenic factors (VFS) and a co-culture system with human melanoma cells. Both systems efficiently activated LECs, and under these experimental conditions RNA sequencing was exploited to unveil the transcriptional profile of activated LECs. Our data demonstrate that both recombinant and tumor cell-mediated activation trigger significant molecular pathways associated with endothelial activation, morphogenesis and cytokine-mediated signaling.

Here, we report the first genome-wide profiles of primary LNETs’ cis-regulatory elements by H3K27ac ChIP-seq with matching RNA-seq profiles. Analysis of these regulatory landscapes revealed three regulatory subtypes, independent of the typical/atypical classification. We identified unique differentiation signals that delineate each subtype. The “proneuronal” subtype emerges under the influence of ASCL1, SOX4 and TCF4 transcription factors, embodying a pronounced proneuronal signature. The “luminal-like” subtype is characterized by gain of acetylation at markers of luminal cells and GATA2 activation, and loss of LRP5 and OTP. The “HNF+” subtype is characterized by a robust enhancer landscape driven by HNF1A, HNF4A, and FOXA3, with notable acetylation and expression of FGF signaling genes, especially FGFR3 and FGFR4, pivotal components of the FGF pathway. Our findings not only deepen the understanding of LNETs' regulatory and developmental diversity but also spotlight the HNF+ subtype's reliance on FGFR signaling. We demonstrate that targeting this pathway with FGF inhibitors curtails tumor growth both in vitro and in xenograft models, unveiling a potential vulnerability and paving the way for targeted therapies.

In addition to genetic mutations, recent research has identified a role for non-genetic plasticity in transient drug tolerance and the acquisition of stable resistance. However, the dynamics of cell-state transitions that occur in the adaptation to cancer therapies remain unknown and require a systems-level longitudinal framework. Here we demonstrate that resistance develops through trajectories of cell-state transitions accompanied by a progressive increase in cell fitness, which we denote as the 'resistance continuum'. This cellular adaptation involves a stepwise assembly of gene expression programmes and epigenetically reinforced cell states underpinned by phenotypic plasticity, adaptation to stress and metabolic reprogramming. Our results support the notion that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or stemness programmes-often considered a proxy for phenotypic plasticity-enable adaptation, rather than a full resistance mechanism. Through systematic genetic perturbations, we identify the acquisition of metabolic dependencies, exposing vulnerabilities that can potentially be exploited therapeutically. The concept of the resistance continuum highlights the dynamic nature of cellular adaptation and calls for complementary therapies directed at the mechanisms underlying adaptive cell-state transitions.",GSE247684,6,18573,38987605

Multiple anticancer drugs are thought to cause cell death via increasing mitochondrial ROS which are a bioproduct of oxidative phosphorylation. However, when properly titrated, ROS can also promote cancer cell adaptation. In keeping line with this, upregulation of mitochondrial respiration coupled to high ROS-scavenging capacity is a characteristic shared by drug-tolerant cells in several cancers. Translational fidelity in the mitochondria and in the cytosol is essential for cell fitness and thus oxidative damage to the ribosomes should be prevented at all costs. While mechanisms for recognizing and repairing such damage exist in the cytoplasm, the status within mitochondria remains unclear. By performing ascorbate peroxidase (APEX)-proximity ligation assay directed to the mitochondrial matrix followed by isolation and sequencing of RNA associated to mitochondrial proteins, we identified the nuclear encoded lncRNA ROSALIND as a interacting partner of ribosomes. ROSALIND is upregulated in recurrent tumours and its expression can discriminate between responders and non-responders to immune checkpoint blockade in a melanoma cohort of patients. Featuring an unusually high G content, ROSALIND serves as a substrate for oxidation. Consequently, inhibiting ROSALIND leads to an increase in ROS and protein oxidation, resulting in severe mitochondrial respiration defects. This, in turn, impairs melanoma cell viability and immunogenicity both in vitro and ex vivo in preclinical humanized cancer models. These findings underscore the role of ROSALIND as a novel ROS buffering system, safeguarding mitochondrial translation from oxidative stress, and shed light on potential therapeutic strategies for overcoming cancer therapy resistance.",GSE249588,12,20301,39294440

However, it remains unclear how lineage factors interact with ADT to endow the lineage transition. Through an integrated analysis of NEPC-based CRISPR-Cas9 screening and scRNA-seq tracking of tumor transitions, we unveil that antiandrogen-induced ZMYND8-dependent epigenetic programming orchestrates the transdifferentiation of NEPC. We demonstrate that the ablation of Zmynd8 restricts NEPC development in Pten/Trp53/Rb1 knockout mouse models. Conversely, ASCL1-induced upregulation of ZMYND8 shapes the neuroendocrine (NE) lineage to confer resistance to AR-targeted therapy. Mechanistically, FOXM1, a key regulator in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), stabilizes ZMYND8 binding to chromatin regions harboring H3K4me1-K14ac modification and FOXM1 targeting. Antiandrogen treatment frees the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex from AR, enabling its interaction with ZMYND8/FOXM1 to upregulate key NE lineage regulators (e.g., FOXA2, SOX2, and POU3F2), thus inducing transdifferentiation. Having identified ZMYND8's link to adverse disease outcomes in CRPC patients, we develop a small molecule, ZMYND8i-34, designed to selectively inhibit its histone recognition. In pre-clinical models, ZMYND8i-34 treatment effectively blocks NE transdifferentiation and curtails CRPC development. Together, our results highlight the importance of antiandrogen treatment endowing ZMYND8-dependent epigenetic reprogramming to orchestrate lineage fate and suggest that targeting ZMYND8 may hold the potential to restrict NEPC development and overcome treatment resistance.",GSE249888,24,24676,NA

AREG and PLAUR were expressed in the CD68+CD163+IL-1β+ subcluster, PLCG2 and NCKAP5 were expressed in CD68+CD163+IL-1β- subcluster and AUTS2 and SPP1 were expressed in the CD68+CD163-IL-1β+ subcluster. RT-qPCR showed expression of several macrophage markers in VS of which CD14, ALOX15, Interleukin-1β, INHBA and Colony Stimulating Factor-1R were found to have a high correlation with tumor volume. Conclusions: Macrophages form an important component of VS stroma. scRNAseq reveals three distinct subsets of macrophages in the VS tissue which may have differing roles in the pathogenesis of VS.",GSE250061,3,30173,38480935

However, how the neuroblastoma cells switch their cell states during therapy remains largely unknown and how to eradicate neuroblastoma cells regardless of their cell state alterations is a clinical challenge. By using four distinct human and murine neuroblastoma models treated with indisulam, a molecular glue drug serving as a selective RBM39 degrader, we show that cancer cells not only can undergo bidirectional switch of ADRN and MES cell states, but also can acquire additional cell states of melanoma and Schwann cell progenitors, reminiscent of the cellular pliancy of neural crest cells. The lineage alterations of neuroblastoma cells are coupled with epigenetic changes and dependency switch of lineage-specific transcription factors. Nevertheless, indisulam treatment induces an inflamed tumor microenvironment leading to an immune cell infiltration. The combination of indisulam with anti-GD2 monoclonal immunotherapy results in a durable complete response in transgenic neuroblastoma models driven by MYCN and ALK mutant oncogenes, providing a therapeutic rationale to eradicate tumor cells even when they acquire alternative cell lineage(s) in response to treatment.",GSE251918,8,24247;24676,38585889

A major contributor to treatment failure is drug-induced cellular adaptation to therapy, whereby systems-level reprogramming permits a drug-tolerant phenotype that may gradually lead to cell cycle re-entry and portend relapse. Drug adaptation is known to rapidly implicate complex signaling and transcriptional regulatory networks, but the scale and temporal dynamics of these remodeling events have yet to be fully resolved. Here, we used mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics and RNA sequencing to capture molecular snapshots within the first minutes, hours, and days of BRAF kinase inhibitor exposure in a drug-tolerant human BRAF-mutant melanoma model. By enriching specific phospho-motifs associated with mitogenic kinases, we were able to detect and monitor thousands of protein phosphorylation sites over a three-day period of drug treatment, followed by a six-day drug holiday to characterize the plasticity of the adaptive response. We observed early and sustained inhibition of the BRAF-ERK axis, gradual downregulation of canonical cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation events, and a clear delineation between three distinct phase transitions toward drug tolerance, which was almost completely reversible following drug removal. Through measuring the time evolution of large-scale networks, we were able to exploit phosphoproteome and transcriptome dynamics to infer kinetically-defined regulatory modules, revealing a concerted response to oncogenic BRAF inhibition involving cellular metabolism, RNA processing, and mitogenic signaling that demonstrated strong agreement with prior knowledge. The adaptive response to BRAF inhibition was dominated by a compensatory induction of SRC-family kinase (SFK) signaling, which we found to be at least partially driven by impaired redox homeostasis and accumulation of reactive oxygen species – providing a fine degree of temporal, mechanistic, and phosphorylation site-specific context to an important axis in tumor cell survival. This induction sensitized cells to co-treatment with an SFK inhibitor, and combination therapy significantly outperformed single-agent BRAF inhibition across a panel of patient-derived melanoma cell lines and in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model, underscoring the high translational potential for measuring the temporal dynamics of signaling and transcription networks under therapeutic challenge.",GSE252781,13,16791,NA

To decipher the genes and pathways affected by α-syn, we conducted an RNA sequencing analysis of human SK-MEL-28 cells and several SK-MEL-28 SNCA-KO clones. We identified 1098 significantly up-regulated genes and 660 significantly down-regulated genes. Several of the upregulated genes are related to the immune system, i.e., the inflammatory response and the matrisome. We validated five upregulated genes (IL-1ý, SAA1, IGFBP5, CXCL8, and CXCL10) by RT-qPCR and detected IGFBP5 and IL-1ý in spent media of control and SNCA-KO cells. The levels of each of these secreted proteins were significantly higher in the spent media of the SNCA-KO clones than control cells.

Cancers have developed mechanisms to render DCs dysfunctional within the tumor microenvironment. Utilizing CD63 as a unique surface marker, we demonstrate that mature regulatory DCs (mregDCs) suppress DC antigen cross-presentation while driving TH2 and regulatory T cell differentiation within tumor-draining lymph node tissues. Transcriptional and metabolic studies show that mregDC functionality is dependent upon the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway and the master transcription factor, SREBP2. Melanoma-derived lactate activates DC SREBP2 in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and drives mregDC development from conventional DCs. DC-specific genetic silencing and pharmacologic inhibition of SREBP2 promotes anti-tumor CD8+ T cell activation and suppresses melanoma progression. CD63+ mregDCs reside within the sentinel lymph nodes of melanoma patients. Collectively, this work describes a tumor-driven SREBP2-dependent program that promotes CD63+ mregDC development and function while serving as a promising therapeutic target for overcoming immune tolerance in the TME.",GSE253590,2,24676,38728412

In this study, we combined single-cell RNA-sequencing with barcoding to track resistant clones through prolonged and sequential treatments. We found that cells within the same clone have similar gene expression states after multiple rounds of treatment. Moreover, we demonstrated that individual clones have distinct and differing fates, including growth, survival, or death, when subjected to a second treatment or when the first treatment is continued.

Methods: Based on public databases, the m6A-related gene expression landscape in SKCM was portrayed. MeRIP-Seq and RNA-Seq were used to recognize the downstream target of ALKBH5. In vivo and in vitro functional phenotype and rescue functional experiments were performed to explore the mechanism of the ALKBH5-ABCA1 axis in SKCM. Results: We found ALKBH5 upregulated in SKCM, associated with poor prognosis. ALKBH5 can promote melanoma cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion and inhibit autophagy in vitro, facilitating tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. We identified ABCA1, a membrane protein that assists cholesterol efflux, as a downstream target of ALKBH5-mediated m6A demethylation. Finally, our data demonstrated that ALKBH5 promoted SKCM via mediating ABCA1 downregulation by reducing ABCA1 mRNA stability in an m6A-dependent manner.

MCPyV-encoded T-antigens (TAs) are pivotal for sustaining MCC’s oncogenic phenotype, i.e., repression of TAs results in reactivation of the RB pathway and subsequent cell cycle arrest. However, the MCC cell line LoKe, characterized by a homozygous loss of the RB1 gene, exhibits uninterrupted cell cycle progression after shRNA-mediated TA repression. This unique feature allows an in-depth analysis of the effects of TAs beyond inhibition of the RB pathway, revealing the decrease in expression of stem cell-related genes upon panTA-knockdown. Analysis of gene regulatory networks identified members of the E2F family (E2F1, E2F8, TFDP1) as key transcriptional regulators that maintain stem cell properties in TA-expressing MCC cells. Furthermore, minichromosome maintenance (MCM) genes, which encodes DNA-binding license proteins essential for stem cell maintenance, were suppressed upon panTA-knockdown. The decline in stemness occurred simultaneously with neural differentiation, marked by the increased expression of neurogenesis-related genes such as neurexins, BTG2, and MYT1L. This upregulation can be attributed to heightened activity of PBX1 and BPTF, crucial regulators of neurogenesis pathways. The observations in LoKe were confirmed in an additional MCPyV-positive MCC cell line in which RB1 was silenced prior to panTA-knockdown. Moreover, spatially resolved transcriptomics demonstrated reduced TA expression in situ in a part of a MCC tumor characterized by neural differentiation. In summary, TAs are critical for maintaining stemness of MCC cells and suppressing neural differentiation, irrespective of their impact on the RB-signaling pathway.",GSE254170,3,24676,38988206

We found that the lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) EP300 and SOX10 gene loci on Chromosome 22 are frequently co-amplified in melanomas, including UV-associated and acral tumors. We further show that p300 KAT activity mediates SOX10 protein stability and that the p300 inhibitor, A-485, downregulates SOX10 protein levels in melanoma cells via proteasome-mediated degradation. Additionally, A-485 potently inhibits proliferation of SOX10+ melanoma cells while decreasing invasion in AXLhigh/MITFlow melanoma cells through downregulation of metastasis-related genes.

Standard of care involves a combination of inhibitors targeting mutant BRAF and MEK1/2, the substrate for BRAF in the MAPK pathway. PTEN loss of function mutations occur in 40% of BRAFV600E melanomas, resulting in increased PI3K/AKT activity that enhances resistance to BRAF/MEK combination inhibitor therapy. To compare the response of PTEN null to PTEN wild type cells in an isogenic background, CRISPR was used to knock out PTEN a melanoma cell line that harbors a BRAFV600E mutation. RNA sequencing and functional kinome analysis revealed the loss of PTEN led to an induction of FOXD3 and an increase in expression of the FOXD3 target gene, ERBB3/HER3. Inhibition of BRAF and MEK1/2 in PTEN null, BRAFV600Ecells dramatically induced expression of ERBB3/HER3 relative to wild type cells. A synergy screen of epigenetic modifiers and kinase inhibitors in combination with BRAFi/MEKi identified the pan ERBB/HER inhibitor, neratinib, as reversing the resistance observed in PTEN null, BRAFV600Ecells. The findings indicate that PTEN null BRAFV600E melanoma exhibits increased reliance on ERBB/HER signaling when treated with clinically approved BRAFi/MEKi combinations.

Although research focuses on how the accumulation of oncogene and tumor suppressor gene mutations in melanocytes drive melanoma development, how alterations in keratinocytes serve as extrinsic drivers of melanoma initiation and progression is poorly understood. We recently identified keratinocyte desmoglein 1 (Dsg1) as an important mediator of keratinocyte:melanoma crosstalk. Here we address the extent to which Dsg1 loss, which occurs in response to acute environmental stress such as ultraviolet radiation, affects early steps in melanomagenesis. RNA-Seq analysis revealed that paracrine signals from Dsg1-deficient keratinocytes mediate a transcriptional switch from a differentiated to undifferentiated cell state in melanocytes expressing BRAFV600E. Of 221 differentially expressed genes in BRAFV600E cells treated with Dsg1-deficient conditioned media (CM), the laminin superfamily member NTN4/Netrin-4, which inhibits senescence in endothelial cells, stood out. Indeed, while BRAFV600E melanocytes treated with Dsg1-deficient CM showed signs of senescence bypass, knockdown of NTN4 reversed these effects. These results suggest that Dsg1 loss in keratinocytes provides an extrinsic signal to push melanocytes towards oncogenic transformation once an initial mutation has been introduced.",GSE255546,18,24676,39581457

This intricate biological trait poses significant challenges to current therapeutics approaches, emphasizing the urgent need for innovative treatment strategies. Here, we initially demonstrated the efficacy of Lurbinectedin, a synthetic ecteinascidin derived from marine sources, against melanoma cells, irrespective of their driver mutations or phenotypic manifestations. Subsequently, we designed and evaluated two derivatives of Lurbinectedin, termed Ecubectedin and PM54(Comp IA), both of which fully recapitulate the cytotoxic effects of Lurbinectedin in vitro and might present benefits versus the original compound. These derivatives also exert a noteworthy in vivo impact on tumor growth and animal survival, inducing apoptosis in melanoma cells. Mechanistically, our investigations revealed that ecteinascidins strongly inhibit oncogenic super-enhancer-mediated gene expression by a three-pronged mechanism. Firstly, the binding to the promoters of lineage-specific master transcription factors and the disruption of their associated auto-regulatory circuits, secondly, the binding and inhibition of genes encoding ubiquitous transcription factors/coactivators, heavily enriched at oncogenic SEs, and thirdly, the direct drug-binding to these regulatory elements, seemingly hampering the assembly of transcriptional condensates, all likely work in tandem to disrupt oncogene expression.

Restored glycolysis, frequently found in clinical targeted therapy-resistant melanoma biopsies, has been shown to elicit drug resistance. How resumed glycolysis controls the emergence of acquired resistance, especially via intrinsic mechanisms that circumvent the BRAF/MEK module, remains unknown. Here, we identify lactylation of LSD1, induced by re-accumulated lactate in DTR melanoma cells, selectively drives survival via epigenetic reprogramming. Mechanistically, lactylation of LSD1 promotes its interaction with FosL1, thereby preventing its ubiquitination and degradation by E3 ligase tripartite-motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21). In DTR melanoma cells, chromatin binding capacity of FosL1 was significantly strengthened due to reduced acetylation, which in turn increases selective chromatin enrichment of LSD1. We further demonstrate that lactylated LSD1 co-orchestrates gene transcription with FosL1 to repress ferroptosis in DTR cells via interfering with transferrin receptor protein 1 (TFRC)-mediated iron uptake. LSD1 inhibitor (LSD1i) activates ferroptosis, resulting in drastic DTR melanoma regression in mice. Importantly, LSD1i-induced immunogenic ferroptosis synergizes with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) in vivo. Together, our results highlight a crucial role of metabolic rewiring-induced epigenetic reprogramming as a bypass resistance mechanism in DTR melanoma, which provides a therapeutically actionable strategy to overcome acquired resistance to targeted therapy.",GSE256122,18,20795,NA

Tumor classification based on CNV also showed significant value in evaluating prognosis. However, the difference between CNV and histological grading is unclear. Here, at single cell level, we analyzed the heterogeneity of tumor cells according to two classification criteria, genomic instability (including CNV alteration and tumor mutation burden) and histological grading. We found that the classification basis on genomic instability of the bulk tissues was better than histological grading in distinguishing tumor cells at scRNA-seq. We revealed that the activated core pathways of tumor cells were significantly different under different histological gradings and genomic instability patterns. In particular, patients with liver metastases had specific activation pathways. Deciphering the differences of the tumor microenvironment through single-cell sequencing, we found that tip cells, lymphatic endothelial cells, macrophages, CD1A+ dendritic cell, Treg, MAIT, ILC and CAFs might patriciate in the process of hepatic metastases, which will facilitate the understanding of the patterns to decode the malignant potential and of NF-Pan-NET.",GSE256136,20,24676,NA

Despite the approval of combination immune checkpoint therapy (ICT) for other kidney cancers, its efficacy against RMC remains elusive. We conducted a prospective clinical trial of nivolumab plus ipilimumab in patients with RMC. Enrollment was halted for futility after a prespecified interim analysis revealed that all 10 patients experienced rapid disease progression with 5/10 meeting radiological criteria for hyperprogression. Median progression-free survival was only 1.38 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28, 1.60). To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we analyzed high-quality single-cell RNA sequencing data from RMC patients before and after nivolumab plus ipilimumab treatment. Our analysis suggested that ICT-triggered interferon gamma upregulation induces RMC tumor cells to activate key myeloid regulators such as the CEBPB / p300 complex that promote tumor cell proliferation leading to hyperprogression. Using an immunocompetent somatic mosaic genetically engineered mouse model of RMC, we confirmed that combination ICT induced hyperprogression of primary and metastatic tumors compared with IgG control by hijacking myeloid-affiliated transcriptional circuits. Blocking of this “myeloid mimicry” adaptive mechanism using a selective inhibitor of p300 induced sensitivity to combination ICT in our animal model of RMC.

Methods: This study investigated immunological and cellular responses using single-cell and spatial analysis of skin biopsies from patients with metastatic uveal melanoma treated with tebentafusp. Results: 81.8% of patients developed acute cutaneous adverse events, which correlated with improved survival. Multimodal analysis revealed a brisk infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, while melanocyte numbers declined. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed T-cell activation, proliferation, and IFN-γ/cytotoxic gene upregulation. CD8+ T-cells co-localized with melanocytes and upregulated LAG3, suggesting potential for combination therapies with tebentafusp. Melanocytes upregulated antigen presentation and apoptotic pathways, while pigmentation gene expression decreased. However, gp100 remained stably expressed.

It’s ability to dynamically shift between transcriptional states or phenotypes results in an adaptive cell plasticity that may drive cancer cell invasion or the development of therapy resistance. The expression of peroxidasin (PXDN), an extracellular matrix peroxidase, has been proposed to be associated with the invasive metastatic melanoma phenotype. We have confirmed this association by analysing the transcriptomes of 70 metastatic melanoma cell lines with variable levels of PXDN expression. This analysis highlighted a strong association between high PXDN expression and the undifferentiated invasive melanoma phenotype. To assess the functional role of PXDN in melanoma invasion, we performed a knockout of PXDN in a highly invasive cell line (NZM40). PXDN knockout decreased the invasive potential by ~50 % and decreased the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasive marker genes as determined by RNAseq and substantiated by proteomics analysis.

While several studies have linked TGFβ signaling to elevated resistance to targeted therapy in melanoma, separate findings have indicated a favorable treatment response through TGFβ-mediated increase of cell death. We now found that the outcome of TGFβ signaling in the context of targeted therapy is dose dependent. Unlike low doses, high levels of TGFβ signal activation induce apoptosis upon simultaneous MAPK pathway inhibition, even in targeted therapy resistant melanoma cell lines. Using transcriptomic analyses, combined with genomic target identification of the critical TGFβ signaling effector SMAD4, we demonstrate that parallel activation of TGFβ signaling and MAPK pathway inhibition causes a complete switch of TGFβ target genes from promoting pro-invasive processes to fueling pro-apoptotic pathways. Investigations of underlying mechanisms identified a novel apoptosis-inducing gene signature. Functional validation of signature members confirmed the deubiquitinating enzyme BAP1, the ubiquitin conjugation factor UBE4B and the pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member BCL2L11 (BIM) to mediate apoptosis in this condition.

However, the mechanisms underlying the progression of paraptosis in cancer cells are largely unknown. Methods: Paraptosis-inducing agents, CPYPP, cyclosporin, and curcumin, were utilized to investigate the underlying mechanism of paraptosis. Next-generation sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis revealed significant changes in gene and protein expressions. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were employed to elucidate the transcriptional events related to paraptosis. The xenograft mouse models were employed to evaluate the potential of paraptosis as an anti-cancer strategy. Results: CPYPP, cyclosporin A, and curcumin induced cytoplasmic vacuolization and triggered paraptosis in cancer cells. The paraptotic program involved reactive oxygen species (ROS) provocation and the activation of proteostatic dynamics, leading to transcriptional activation associated with redox homeostasis and proteostasis. Both pharmacological and genetic approaches suggested that cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 7/9 drive paraptotic progression in a mutually-dependent manner with heat shock proteins (HSPs). Proteostatic stress, such as accumulated cysteine-thiols, HSPs, ubiquitin-proteasome system, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and unfolded protein response, as well as ROS provocation primarily within the nucleus, enforced CDK7/CDK9–Rpb1 (RNAPII subunit B1) activation by potentiating its interaction with HSPs and protein kinase R (PKR) in a forward loop, amplifying transcriptional regulation and thereby exacerbating proteotoxicity leading to initiate paraptosis. A xenograft mouse model with OECM-1 cells further confirmed the induction of paraptosis against tumor growth.

NK cells have clinical potential; However, multiple current limitations exist that naturally hinder the successful implementation of NK cell therapy against cancer, including their effector function, persistence, and tumor infiltration. To unbiasedly identify genes underlying critical NK cell characteristics against cancer, we perform functional mapping of tumor infiltrating NK (TINK) cells by both in vivo AAV-CRISPR screens and single-cell sequencing. We establish a strategy with AAV-SleepingBeauty(SB)-CRISPR screening leveraging a focused high-density sgRNA library, and perform four independent in vivo tumor infiltration screens of primary NK cells in mouse models of melanoma, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma. In parallel, we characterize single-cell transcriptomic landscapes of tumor-infiltrating NK cells, which identifies previously unexplored sub-populations of NK cells with distinct expression profiles, a shift from immature to mature NK (mNK) cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and decreased expression of mature marker genes in mNK cells. CALHM2, a calcium homeostasis modulator previously not linked to NK function, emerges as a convergent hit from both CRISPR screen and single-cell data. CALHM2 knockout NK cells show enhancement of in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo tumor infiltration in both mouse primary NK and human chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK cells. Re-introduction of CALHM2 mRNA reverses CALHM2 knockout phenotype of NK cytotoxicity and degranulation. Importantly, in a solid tumor model that is completely resistant to adoptive cell therapy of unmodified CAR-NK cells, CALHM2 knockout CAR-NK cells show potent in vivo anti-tumor efficacy. Human primary NK cell study with multiple donors reveals that CALHM2 knockout enhances cytotoxicity, degranulation and cytokine production of NK cells. Transcriptomics profiling of human primary NK cells reveal multiple enriched pathways of downstream genes upon CALHM2 knockout in both baseline and stimulated conditions.

To uncover resistance mechanisms, we performed single cell RNA sequencing of fine needle aspirates from resistant and responding tumors from melanoma patients before and during BRAFi/MEKi treatment. Among the genes most differentially expressed between malignant cells from resistant vs. responding tumors was POSTN encoding the secreted factor periostin. POSTN was predicted to predominantly signal to a macrophage population associated with targeted therapy resistance (TTR). Accordingly, tumors from patients with fast disease progression after targeted therapy exhibited high POSTN expression levels as well as high numbers of TTR macrophages, and POSTN was able to polarize macrophages towards a TTR phenotype. In a mouse model in vivo, POSTN expression protected melanoma from targeted therapy, which was associated with a phenotype change of intratumroal macrophages. Finally, polarized TTR macrophages protected melanoma cells from MEKi-induced killing through CD44 receptor expression on melanoma cells. Thus, interfering with the protective activity of TTR macrophages might represent a strategy to overcome resistance to targeted therapy in melanoma.",GSE262779,10,34284,38942020

Skin cells attempt to repair these damages by activating cascades of DNA Damage Response mechanisms to safeguard genome integrity, thereby preventing skin cancers. The role of PPARb - a druggable transcription factor, in the development of UV-dependent skin cancers is not mechanistically elucidated. We have shown previously that PPARb knockout mice are less prone to UV-induced skin cancers. Here, we report on our global transcriptomic analysis revealing that PPARb directly regulates gene expression programs associated with cell cycle and DNA repair pathways in normal human epidermal keratinocytes. We show that in these cells, as well as in malignant human keratinocytes and in human melanoma cells, PPARb controls cellular proliferation and cell cycle progression and its depletion leads to cell cycle arrest. We also show that PPARb controls the response of normal human epidermal keratinocytes to UV-induced DNA damage. PPARb depletion decreases the expression and/or activation of multiple effectors of DNA Damage Response (DDR) pathway and favours the apoptotic response of human keratinocytes to UV irradiation. Our preclinical data of a PDX melanoma model demonstrated that the depletion or inhibition of PPARb delays of blocks tumor formation. Our data suggest that PPARb inhibition can be considered as a therapeutic target for the prevention of UV-induced skin cancers in vulnerable population, by attenuating the DDR and eliminating skin cells with high UV-induced mutational burden.",GSE263846,48,24676,39620966

RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis of ICB-resistant melanomas demonstrated activation of several targetable pathways. HTDS targeting these pathways identified several effective combinations in ICB-resistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Cobi+Reg emerged as the most promising regimen, with efficacy against distinct molecular melanoma subtypes and following progression on ICB in immunocompetent models. RNA-Seq analysis of Cobi+Reg-treated tumors demonstrated upregulation of antigen presentation machinery, with concomitantly increased activated T cell infiltration. Combining Cobi+Reg with ICB was superior to either treatment in vivo.

While beneficial to the approximately 50% of patients with activating BRAFV600 mutation, mono- and combination therapy with MAPK inhibitors is ultimately associated with acquired resistance. To better characterize the mechanisms of MAPK inhibitor resistance in melanoma, we utilize patient-derived xenografts and apply proteogenomic approaches leveraging genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic technologies that permit the identification of resistance-specific alterations and therapeutic vulnerabilities. A specific challenge for proteogenomic applications comes at the level of data curation to enable multi-omics data integration. Here, we present a proteogenomic approach that uses custom curated databases to identify unique resistance-specific alternations in melanoma PDX models of acquired MAPK inhibitor resistance. We demonstrate this approach with a NRASQ61L melanoma PDX model from which resistant tumors were developed following treatment with a MEK inhibitor. Our multi-omics strategy addresses current challenges in bioinformatics by leveraging development of custom curated proteogenomics databases derived from individual resistant melanoma that evolves following MEK inhibitor treatment and is scalable to comprehensively characterize acquired MAPK inhibitor resistance across patient-specific models and genomic subtypes of melanoma.",GSE266762,5,24676,NA

We hypothesized that multiparametric analysis of pre-metastatic liver biopsies will classify patients according to their metastatic risk, timing, and organ site. Liver biopsies obtained during pancreatectomy from 49 patients with localized PaC and 19 control patients with non-cancerous pancreatic lesions were analyzed combining metabolomic, tissue and single cell transcriptomics, and multiplex imaging approaches. Patients were followed prospectively (median three years) and classified into four recurrence groups; early (<6 months post resection) or late (>6 months post resection) liver metastasis (LiM), extrahepatic (EHM) metastasis, and disease-free survivors (NED). Overall, PaC livers exhibited signs of augmented inflammation, compared to controls. Enrichment of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), Ki-67 upregulation, and decreased liver creatine significantly distinguished those with future metastasis from NED. Patients with future LiM were characterized by scant T cell lobular infiltration, less steatosis, and higher levels of citrullinated H3, compared to patients who developed EHM metastasis, who had overexpression of interferon target genes (MX1, NR1D1) and an increase of CD11B+ NK cells. Upregulation of sortilin-1 and prominent NETs, together with the lack of T cells and a reduction in CD11B+ NK cells, differentiated patients with early-onset from those with late-onset LiM. Liver profiles of NED closely resembled those of controls. Using the above parameters, a machine learning-based model was developed that successfully predicted the metastatic outcome at the time of surgery with 78% accuracy. Therefore, multiparametric profiling of liver biopsies at the time of PaC diagnosis may determine metastatic risk and organotropism, and guide clinical stratification for optimal treatment selection.",GSE267209,8,18573,38942992

Current treatment strategies have failed to significantly improve the prognosis for MM patients. This study aims to identify therapeutic targets and develop combination strategies by investigating the mechanisms underlying the tumorigenesis and progression of MM. Methods: We analyzed the copy number amplification of EZH2 in 547 melanoma patients and investigated its correlation with clinical prognosis. Utilizing cell lines, organoids, and patient-derived xenograft models, we assessed the impact of EZH2 on cell proliferation and sensitivity to ferroptosis. Further, we explored the mechanisms of ferroptosis resistance associated with EZH2 by conducting RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing. Results: EZH2 copy number amplification was closely associated with malignant phenotype and poor prognosis in MM patients. EZH2 was essential for MM cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, genetic perturbation of EZH2 rendered MM cells sensitized to ferroptosis. Combination treatment of EZH2 inhibitor with ferroptosis inducer significantly inhibited the growth of MM. Mechanistically, EZH2 inhibited the expression of KLF14, which binds to the promoter of SLC7A11 to repress its transcription. Loss of EZH2 therefore reduced the expression of SLC7A11, leading to reduced intracellular SLC7A11-dependent glutathione synthesis to promote ferroptosis. Conclusion: Our findings not only establish EZH2 as a biomarker for MM prognosis, but also highlight the EZH2-KLF14-SLC7A11 axis as a potential target for MM treatment.",GSE269789,6,24676,NA

In contrast to SCLC, however, there is little evidence to guide optimal treatment strategies which are often adapted from SCLC and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) approaches. While there have been some efforts to describe the molecular landscape of LCNEC, to date there are few links between distinct biologic phenotypes of LCNEC and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Experimental design: To better define the biology of LCNEC, we analyzed cell line and patient genomic data and performed immunohistochemistry and single-cell (sc)RNAseq of core needle biopsies from LCNEC patients and preclinical models. Results: Here, we demonstrate that the presence or absence of YAP1 distinguishes two subsets of LCNEC. The YAP1-high subset is mesenchymal and inflamed and characterized, alongside TP53 mutations, by co-occurring alterations in CDKN2A/B and SMARCA4. Therapeutically, the YAP1-high subset demonstrates vulnerability to MEK and AXL targeting strategies, including a novel preclinical AXL CAR-T cell, as well as predicted vulnerability to SMARCA2 degraders and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Meanwhile, the YAP1-low subset is epithelial and immune-cold and more commonly features TP53 and RB1 co-mutations, similar to those observed in pure SCLC. Notably, the YAP1-low subset is also characterized by expression of SCLC subtype-defining transcription factors - especially ASCL1 and NEUROD1 - and, as expected given its transcriptional similarities to SCLC, exhibits putative vulnerabilities reminiscent of SCLC, including Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) and CD56 targeting, as with novel preclinical DLL3 and CD56 CAR T-cells, and DNA damage repair (DDR) inhibition. Conclusion: YAP1 defines distinct subsets of LCNEC with unique biology.

During metastatic spread, melanoma cells often undergo dedifferentiation toward an invasive phenotype, resulting in reduced expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-dependent melanoma antigens and facilitating immune escape. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is known to be a key factor in melanoma dedifferentiation. Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that TNF may play a role in melanoma progression and resistance to immunotherapies. Additionally, TNF has been identified as a potent regulator of sphingolipid (SL) metabolism, which could contribute to melanoma aggressiveness and the process of melanoma dedifferentiation. Methods: We conducted RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses to investigate TNF-induced dedifferentiation in two melanoma cell lines. In vitro experiments were performed to manipulate sphingolipid metabolism using genetic or pharmacologic alterations in combination with TNF treatment, aiming to elucidate the potential involvement of this metabolism in TNF-induced dedifferentiation. Lastly, to evaluate the clinical significance of our findings, we performed unsupervised analysis of plasma sphingolipid levels in 48 patients receiving treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or in combination with anti-TNF therapy. Results: Herein, we demonstrate that TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation is associated with a global modulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Specifically, TNF decreases the expression and activity of acid ceramidase (AC), encoded by the ASAH1 gene, while increasing the expression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), encoded by the UGCG gene. Remarkably, knockdown of AC alone via RNA interference is enough to induce melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Furthermore, treatment with Eliglustat, a GCS inhibitor, inhibits TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Lastly, analysis of plasma samples from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, with or without anti-TNF therapy, revealed significant predictive sphingolipids. Notably, the top 8 predictive sphingolipids, including glycosphingolipids, were associated with a poor response to immunotherapy.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a pivotal role in metastatic progression, yet molecular diversity and upstream regulators remain poorly defined. Glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB), overexpressed in subsets of tumors including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), is implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stemness. Recent single-cell RNA-seq studies have identified GPNMB as a marker of immunosuppressive TAMs associated with poor prognosis, but its mechanistic role in TAM polarization in TNBC has remained unclear. Co-culturing monocytic cells with three-dimensional sphere-forming TNBC cells induces their conversion into GPNMB⁺Siglec-9⁺ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Tumor-derived GPNMB promotes monocyte-to-TAM polarization by inducing secondary GPNMB expression in monocytes, establishing a feed-forward amplification loop. Knockdown of GPNMB in TNBC cells significantly inhibits multiple immunosuppressive TAM subtypes, including Siglec-9⁺ TAM and EMT-associated TAM populations, as inferred from scRNA-seq and validated in patient tumors using bulk RNA-seq deconvolution. Distinct sialylation patterns were identified: tumor-derived GPNMB exhibited α2,3-sialylation, whereas macrophage-derived GPNMB exhibited α2,6-sialylation, enabling differential Siglec-9 recognition. Elevated GPNMB and Siglec-9 expression correlated with poor prognosis in TNBC patient cohorts. Importantly, dual inhibition of Siglec-E (murine Siglec-9 ortholog) and PD-1 suppressed IL-6-dependent EMT, reduced tumor stemness, and significantly limited lung metastasis in vivo.

To better personalize therapy in cancer patients and address therapy relapse, umbrella trials have commenced whereby genomic sequencing of a panel of potentially actionable targets guide therapy selection for patients. However, the superior efficacy of such approaches remains to be seen. We here test the robustness of the umbrella trial rationale by analyzing relationships between genomic status of a gene and the downstream consequences at the protein level of related pathways, and find poor relationships between mutations, copy number amplification, and protein expression and activation. To profile candidate therapeutic strategies that may offer clinical benefit in the context of acquired BRAFi/MEKi resistance, we utilized a repository of patient-derived xenograft models from heavily pretreated patients with resistance to BRAFi/MEKi and/or immunotherapy (R-PDX). With these R-PDXs, we executed in vivo compound repurposing screens using 11 FDA-approved agents from an NCI-portfolio with pan-RTK, non-RTK and/or PI3K-mTOR specificity. We identify dasatinib as capable of restoring sensitivity to BRAFi/MEKi in ~70% of R-PDX models tested. Elevated baseline protein expression of canonical drivers of therapy resistance (e.g., AXL, YAP, HSP70, phospho-AKT) predicts BRAFi/MEKi plus dasatinib treatment sensitivity. We therefore propose that dasatinib plus BRAFi/MEKi combination therapy may restore antitumor efficacy in patients that have relapsed to standard-of-care therapy by broadly targeting proteins critical in melanoma therapy escape. Further, we submit that this experimental PDX paradigm could potentially improve preclinical evaluation of therapeutic modalities and augment our ability to identify biomarker-defined patient subsets that may respond to a given clinical trial. Furthermore, the aged patient population has suboptimal responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antigens. Here, we characterize vaccine-induced responses to SARS-CoV-2 synthetic DNA vaccine antigens in 18-month-old mice and interrogate protection. Aged mice have altered cellular responses, including decreased IFNγ secretion and increased TNFα secretion as compared to young mice. Aged mice had significantly decreased binding and neutralizing antibodies in their serum compared to their young counterparts. Co-immunization with the plasmid-encoded molecular adjuvant adenosine deaminase-1 (pADA) enhanced cellular responses and expanded the breadth of humoral responses in aged mice. pADA co-delivery also altered the gene expression profiles of lymph node lymphocytes in aged animals. Upon challenge pADA co-immunization modestly decreased age-associated morbidity and mortality in ACE2 transgenic and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 challenge models. These data support the use of aged mice as a model for age-associated decreased vaccine immunogenicity and infection-mediated morbidity and mortality in the context of SARS-CoV-2 and provide further support of the use of adenosine deaminase as a molecular adjuvant.",GSE273120,2,30173,NA

Within tumors, cells coexist in different mutable phenotypes that exhibit differential functional properties and drug responses. The definition of these phenotypic states has been challenging to rigorously define with conventional marker-based methods, and more high-parameter molecular methods are cell-destructive, labor-intensive, and can take days to weeks to obtain a readout. To overcome these technical and practical limitations, we utilized the Deepcell platform to perform real-time classification of unlabeled melanoma cells into Melanocytic and Mesenchymal phenotypes. We used 19 patient-derived cell lines with known Melanocytic or Mesenchymal transcription scores to develop the ‘Melanoma Phenotype Classifier’ to phenotype melanoma cells based on morphology alone. A Classifier accuracy of >88% was achieved, and morphology analysis of the images revealed distinct morphotypes for each phenotype, highlighting distinct morphological differences. To further link phenotypic state with multi-dimensional morphological profiles, we performed genetic and chemical perturbations known to shift the phenotypic state. The AI Classifier successfully predicted shifts in phenotype driven by the perturbations. These results further demonstrate how phenotype is linked to distinct morphological changes that are detectable by AI. Lastly, we applied the Melanoma Phenotype Classifier to dissociated biopsy samples, which revealed phenotypic heterogeneity that was confirmed by single cell RNASeq. This work establishes a link between morphology and Melanoma phenotype, and lays the groundwork for the use of morphology as a label-free method of phenotyping viable melanoma cells combined with additional analyses.",GSE273247,41,30882;24676,NA

Some polyomaviruses also express middle tumor antigens (MTs) or alternate LT open reading frames (ALTOs), which are evolutionarily related but have distinct gene structures. MTs are a splice variant of the early transcript whereas ALTOs are overprinted on the second exon of the LT transcript in an alternate reading frame and are translated via an alternative start codon.

Recently, some key glycolytic enzymes, such as GAPDH and PKM2, were reported to regulate mRNA translation. Translational control of gene expression is considered as a critical effector in cancer biology, representing a highly promising area of research. Here, we report that Hexokinase 2 (HK2), a glucose kinase that catalyzes the first step of glycolysis at the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), is an RNA-binding protein (RBP) that regulates mRNA translation in melanoma cell lines. Polysome profiling experiments followed by RNA sequencing indicate that the translational regulation exerted by HK2 is partly independent of the metabolic status or the glycolytic pathway. We found that HK2 specifically regulates translation of the mRNA encoding SOX10, a transcription factor implicated in the regulation of tumor initiation, maintenance, and progression in melanoma. RNA-protein interaction assays, including crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP), indicate that HK2 is an RBP whose interaction with RNA is independent of its enzymatic activity, its ability to bind glucose or its association with the OMM. HK2 directly interacts with the 5’ untranslated region (5’UTR) of the SOX10 mRNA through a stem-loop RNA secondary structure. Using RNA-protein proximity ligation assays and a fluorescence-based ribosome-bound mRNA mapping method (RIBOmap), we found that high glucose conditions, which promotes the release of HK2 from the OMM, induces an increase in HK2-SOX10 mRNA interaction and SOX10 mRNA translation in the cytoplasm. We further showed that HK2-dependent SOX10 mRNA translation is involved in melanoma cell proliferation and colony formation. Collectively, our data highlight a non-metabolic function of HK2 acting as an RBP and translation regulator.",GSE274146,30,24676,NA

Through comprehensive epigenomic profiling of SWI/SNF complexes and their associated chromatin states in melanoma and melanocytes, we found that a subset of PBAF-exclusive regions unexpectedly coexists with PRC2 and repressed chromatin. Time-resolved approaches revealed that PBAF regions are generally less sensitive to ATPase-mediated remodeling compared to BAF sites. Notably, PBAF/PRC2-bound loci are enriched for REST, a transcription factor that represses neuronal genes. In turn, absence of ARID2 and consequent PBAF loss hinders REST ability to bind and inactivate its targets, leading to upregulation of neuronal and synaptic transcripts, a gene signature also associated with ARID2 mutations in melanoma patients.

Mutations or homozygous deletions of MHC-II genes are frequently encountered in B-cell lymphomas that develop in immune-privileged sites, and therefore have been linked to the survival of patients with B-cell lymphoma. However, the understanding of the regulation of MHC class II expression by epigenetic and genetic factors remains incomplete. In this study, we have identified a crucial signaling pathway comprised of the histone H2AK119 deubiquitinase BAP1, the interferon regulatory factor IRF1, and the MHC-II transactivator CIITA, which directly activates the expression of MHC-II cluster genes. Disruption of the BAP1/IRF1/CIITA axis leads to a functional attenuation of MHC-II expression without affecting expression of the genes involved in cell cycle or proliferation. Notably, loss of BAP1 has no effect on B cell lymphoma cell growth in vitro while significantly accelerates tumor growth in immunocompetent mice in vivo. Indeed, by utilizing single-cell RNA-seq, a significant reduction in immune cell infiltration was observed in BAP1-depleted tumors, indicating a potential tumor suppressive function of BAP1 by regulating the tumor microenvironment and immune response. Finally, we demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of PRC1, which deposits histone H2K119Ub and functions as an antagonist of BAP1, could rescue the MHC-II genes in BAP1 deficient B-cell lymphoma cells. These findings establish the rationale for therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring tumor-specific MHC class II expression and enhancing immunotherapy outcomes at epigenetic levels in B-cell lymphoma treatment.",GSE276031,77,24676;18573;24247,39817454

Currently, radiography and histo-pathological classification of the periprosthetic membrane are used retrospectively for diagnosis. Prospective options for early diagnosis and prevention of loosening are not available. In order to approach this challenge, the study presented here aimed to identify molecular biomarkers in single-centre prospectively collected cell and plasma samples from patients. Methods: Four patient cohorts (primary and revision arthroplasty of hip or knee) were defined. Aseptic loosening of implants was assessed by the standardised approach of the Knee Society Total Knee Arthroplasty Roentgenographic Evaluation and Scoring System (KSRESS) which is based on radiolucent lines. Synovial fluid, bone marrow, and blood were collected from a total of 96 patients. Bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) isolated from the bone marrow of patients was performed for 28 samples. The data was analysed by bioinformatic tools. Quantitative real-time PCR served to validate and extend RNA-seq data. Western blots were performed for molecular differentiation. ELISAs were used to quantitate selected protein targets. Results: RNA-seq of MSCs identified glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB) as significantly upregulated in the cells from revision patients compared to patients with primary implantations. The protein encoded by this gene is plasma membrane-standing; its extracellular domain may be cleaved and secreted. In synovial fluid plasma, the soluble GPNMB protein exhibited increased levels in patients undergoing revision surgery compared to patients subjected to primary arthroplasty. No significant differences were observed in bone marrow plasma and blood plasma. The molecular species detected by Western blotting were similar in the plasma fractions of synovial fluid, bone marrow and blood. Conclusions: The use of GPNMB as a biomarker may be of prime importance for early detection of implant loosening, ahead of radiographic failure demonstration. Translational potential of this article: GPNMB has the potential to act as a prospective and quantitative parameter to assess different stages of implant loosening.

While its role as a transcriptional regulator of various cytokines and chemokines in immune cells has been revealed, IκBζ’s function in solid cancer remains unclear. Methods: We investigated IκBζ expression in melanoma, and assessed its impact on target gene expression, tumor growth, and response to immunotherapy in melanoma cell lines, mouse models, and patient samples. Results: Unlike in other cell types, IκBζ protein was found to be constitutively expressed in a subfraction of melanoma cell lines, and around 35% of melanoma cases. This atypical expression pattern of IκBζ did not correlate with its mRNA levels or known driver mutations, but instead seemed to result from changes in its post-transcriptional or post-translational regulation. Deleting constitutively expressed IκBζ abrogated the activity and chromatin association of STAT3 and p65, leading to reduced expression of the pro-proliferative cytokines IL-1β and IL-6 in melanoma cells. Consequently, loss of tumor-derived IκBζ suppressed self-sustained melanoma cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, constitutive IκBζ expression suppressed the induction of the chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL5, which impaired the recruitment of NK and CD8+ T-cells to the tumor, causing resistance to α-PD-1 immunotherapy in mice. Furthermore, the expression of tumor-derived IκBζ also correlated with the absence of CD8+ T-cells in human melanoma samples and progressive disease during immunotherapy. Conclusion: We propose that tumor-derived IκBζ could serve as a new therapeutic target and prognostic marker that characterizes melanoma with high tumor cell proliferation, cytotoxic T- and NK-cell exclusion, and unfavorable immunotherapy responses. Targeting IκBζ expression might open up a new therapy option to re-establish the recruitment of cytotoxic cells, thereby resensitizing for immunotherapy.",GSE277887,6,18573,40562773

This understanding has been furthered by novel methods in DNA barcoding that allow tracking of clones and their cell states during treatment. However, previous studies using these techniques have been limited in their scope, focusing on how single cell-states lead to resistance to a single treatment. In this study, we performed multi-treatment, high-throughput clonal tracking and single-cell RNA-sequencing to trace rare clones through the development of resistance to many different treatments in parallel with the goal of identifying cell states associated with multi-treatment resistance. We found that clones that will go on to develop resistance to one treatment had an increased chance of separately developing resistance to other treatments with diverse mechanisms of action. Additionally, we identified high CD44 expression in treatment-naive cells as a predictor of future resistance to multiple different treatments. Furthermore, for cells within the same treatment condition, we found that differences in gene expression states prior to treatment can lead cells to follow divergent paths towards their ultimate resistance fate. This work provides a framework for extracting targetable gene expression states from complex resistance dynamics across multiple treatments to eliminate multi-treatment resistance.",GSE279162,9,18573,NA

We used deep miR/mRNA sequencing on six low-grade/high-risk, well-differentiated PanNETs compared with seven non-diseased tissues to identify differentially expressed miRs/mRNAs. Then we crossed a list of differentially expressed mRNAs with a list of in silico predicted mRNA targets of the top upregulated/downregulated miRs to generate high probability miR-mRNA interaction networks.

Here, we identify unique interactions of the CoREST repressor complex (LSD1-HDAC1-CoREST) with components of the RNA splicing machinery and their functional consequences in tumorigenesis. Using mass spectrometry, in vivo binding assays, and cryo-EM we find that CoREST complex-splicing factor interactions are direct and perturbed by the CoREST complex selective inhibitor, corin2–5, leading to extensive changes in RNA splicing in melanoma and other malignancies. Moreover, these corin-induced splicing changes are shown to promote global effects on oncogenic and survival-associated splice variants leading to a tumor-suppressive phenotype. Using predictive machine learning models, MHC IP-MS, and ELISpot assays we identify thousands of neopeptides derived from unannotated splice sites which generate corin-induced splice neoantigens that are demonstrated to be immunogenic in vitro. Corin is further shown to reactivate the response to immune checkpoint blockade and promote dramatic expansion of cytotoxic T cells in an immune cold melanoma tumor model, effectively sensitizing them to anti-PD1 immunotherapy. These data position CoREST complex inhibition as a unique therapeutic opportunity in cancer which perturbs oncogenic splicing programs across broad tumor types while also creating tumor-associated neoantigens that enhance the immunogenicity of current therapeutics and may be readily translated to the clinic.",GSE280449,24,20301,NA

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are the smallest functional units of cancer and precursors of fatal metastasis. We previously employed an unbiased multilevel approach to discover a unique ribosomal protein large/small subunits (RPL/RPS) CTC gene signature associated with MBM. Here, we hypothesized that CTC-driven MBM secondary metastasis (?metastasis of metastasis? per clinical scenarios), has targeted organ specificity for liver. We injected parallel cohorts of immunodeficient and newly-developed humanized NBSGW (HuNBSGW) mice with cells from CTC-derived MBM to identify secondary metastatic patterns. We found the presence of a melanoma brain-liver metastasis axis in humanized NBSGW mice. Further, RNA-Seq analyses of tissues showed a significant upregulation of the RPL/RPS CTC gene signature linked to metastatic spread to liver. Additional RNA-Seq of CTCs from HuNBSGW blood revealed extensive CTC clustering with human B cells in these mice. CTC:B cell clusters were also upregulated in blood of primary melanoma patients, and maintained either in CTC-driven MBM or MBM CTC-derived cells promoting liver metastasis. CTC-generated tumor tissues were interrogated at single-cell gene and protein expression levels (10x Genomics Xenium and HALO spatial biology platforms, respectively).

Although absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) has been linked to inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases, and cancers, its role in the EMT of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE-EMT) and retinal diseases remains unclear. The present study demonstrated that AIM2 functions as a potent suppressor of RPE cell proliferation and EMT to maintain retinal homeostasis. Transcriptome analysis using RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) revealed that AIM2 was significantly downregulated in primary human RPE (phRPE) cells undergoing EMT and proliferation. Consequently, Aim2-deficient mice showed morphological changes and increased FN expression in RPE cells under physiological conditions, whereas AIM2 overexpression in phRPE cells inhibited EMT. In a retinal detachment-induced PVR mouse model, AIM2 deficiency promotes RPE-EMT, resulting in severe experimental PVR. Clinical samples further confirmed the downregulation of AIM2 in the PVR membranes from patients. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome analysis revealed that the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway was significantly related to RPE-EMT and that AIM2 inhibited AKT activation in RPE cells by reducing its phosphorylation. Moreover, treatment with eye drops containing an AKT inhibitor alleviated RPE-EMT and the severity of experimental PVR.

RNA-Seq results exhibited altered epigenetic regulation of resistance; particularly ferritin family members, ion transport pathways. Then, increased NCOA4, FTH1, and iron levels detected in A375-R suggest that the iron metabolism-related mechanism, such as ferritinophagy, might be triggered, which was supported by TEM and oxidative stress analysis. Iron storage, transport, and ferritinophagy have the promising potential to be targeted for combining with BRAF-targeted therapy to reverse Encorafenib resistance in MM.

Current assays fail to adequately address the complex biology of BCa subtypes/risk groups and accurately predict responses to treatments like antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). To address these limitations, we developed and validated a novel diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive tool, mFISHseq. Methods: Our approach, mFISHseq, integrates multiplexed RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization with RNA-sequencing, guided by laser capture microdissection. This technique ensures tumor purity, allows unbiased profiling of whole transcriptome data, and explicitly quantifies intratumoral heterogeneity. Results: In a retrospective cohort study involving 1,082 FFPE breast tumors, mFISHseq demonstrated high analytical validity with 93% accuracy compared to immunohistochemistry across training and test sets. Our consensus subtyping approach provided near-perfect concordance with other molecular classifiers (κ > 0.85) and reclassified 30% of samples into subtypes with distinct prognostic implications. Consensus risk groups mitigated misclassification of single samples and provided prognostic information about both early and late relapse. High risk patients had enriched innate and adaptive immune signatures, which predicted response to neoadjuvant immunotherapy. Furthermore, we identified patients responsive to ADCs, as evidenced by a 19-feature classifier for T-DM1 sensitivity, validated on the multicenter, phase II, prospective I-SPY2 trial. To demonstrate the clinical potential, we deployed mFISHseq as a research use only test on 48 patients, revealing insights into the efficacy of novel targeted therapies, such as CDK4/6 inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and ADCs. Conclusion: The mFISHseq method solves a long-standing challenge in the precise diagnosis and classification of BCa subtypes/prognostic risk groups, and allows accurate response prediction for patients, including those treated with immunotherapies and ADCs.",GSE283522,1254,24676,39747865

Interferon-γ (IFNγ) is an integral part of the anti-tumour immune response and can directly induce both differentiational changes and expression of immunosuppressive proteins in melanoma cells. How the differentiation status of melanoma cells affects IFNγ responses remains unclear. Methods Dedifferentiation of melanoma cells was induced via either siRNA or shRNA mediated MITF knockdown and the cells were subsequently treated with IFNγ. Effects of MITF knockdown and IFNγ treatment on gene expression were evaluated via qPCR and RNA sequencing. A Luminex assay was used to analyse the effects of dedifferentiation and IFNγ treatment on cytokine secretion. Effects on PD-L1 protein expression were analysed via flow cytometry and western blotting. Inhibition of the JAK kinases, NF-κB and STAT3 with small molecule inhibitors, and siRNA mediated knockdown of STAT1 and IRF1 was applied to investigate the molecular mechanism behind IFNγ induced PD-L1 expression in dedifferentiated melanoma cells. The effects of inhibitor treatments and siRNA mediated knockdowns were evaluated via qPCR and western blotting. Bioinformatic analyses of publicly available RNA sequencing data, consisting of 45 patient derived melanoma cell lines, with or without IFNγ treatment, was conducted to assess the generalisability of the in vitro results. Results Dedifferentiation renders 624Mel melanoma cells hypersensitive to IFNγ stimulation in a context-dependent manner, resulting in non-additive upregulation of IFNγ-induced genes, increased PD-L1 protein expression and amplified secretion of CCL2, CXCL10 and IL-10. Furthermore, the intensified PD-L1 protein expression occurs through the JAK-STAT1-IRF1 axis. Lastly, dedifferentiated patient derived melanoma cell lines showed enhanced inflammatory signalling in response to IFNγ compared to differentiated cells, and tended to have higher PD-L1 expression, associated with increased IRF1 expression and activity. Conclusions Together, these findings indicate the existence of a molecular context linking dedifferentiation and IFNγ signalling in melanoma which may lead to immune evasion. Furthermore, these results imply that modulating melanoma differentiation may help shape IFNγ responsiveness.",GSE283655,12,24676,39736644

Analysis of clinical data from patients receiving targeted and/or immunotherapy, along with genetic and functional studies in preclinical melanoma models, show that lineage addiction to MITF is retained throughout disease progression, thus providing the rationale to pursue therapeutic inhibition of MITF. However, direct targeting of MITF or other basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-LZ) transcription factors is unprecedented. Here, we report on the fragment-based discovery of high-affinity ligands for MITF. Fragment screening by NMR led to the discovery of weak binders to the kink pocket of MITF, which were optimized to sub-micromolar affinity by structure-based design enabled by crystallography and biophysics. Furthermore, NMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations revealed a dynamic conformational exchange of the two helices in the asymmetric homodimer, which is perturbed by ligand binding.

However, it is unknown whether these cells can be captured as functional clusters from clinical samples. In defined human co-cultures, tumor antigen-recognizing T cells outcompeted unmatched T cells in forming clusters with tumor cells, prompting us to investigate whether this feature could be used to isolate tumor-reactive T cells directly from cancer specimens. By conventional and imaging flow cytometry, we show here that from 21/21 human melanoma metastases, we were able to isolate heterotypic clusters, comprising CD8+ T cells interacting with one or more tumor cells and/or antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Single cell RNA-sequencing revealed that CD8+ T cells from clusters were enriched for tumor-reactive and exhausted gene signatures. Integration with T cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing showed increased clonality of clustered T cells, indicative of expansion. In-depth analyses revealed that these T cells had conjugated with tumor cells and various APCs, each exhibiting specific enriched cell states, which were linked to distinct patterns of cell-cell communication. CD8+ T cells expanded from clusters ex vivo exerted on average 9-fold increased killing activity towards autologous melanomas, accompanied by enhanced cytokine production. Also upon adoptive cell transfer (ACT) into mice, T cells from clusters showed superior patient-derived xenograft (PDX) killing associated with more T cell infiltration and activation. Together, these results demonstrate that tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells are enriched in functional clusters with tumor cells and/or APCs, and that they can be isolated and expanded from clinical samples. Typically excluded during single-cell sorting by flow cytometry, these distinct heterotypic CD8+ T cell clusters serve as a valuable source amenable to deciphering functional tumor-immune cell interactions, while they may also be therapeutically explored.",GSE283942,28,24676,NA

It mainly affects young individuals of African descent with sickle cell trait, and it is resistant to conventional therapies used for other renal cell carcinomas. This study aimed to identify potential biomarkers for early detection and disease monitoring of RMC. Experimental Design: Integrated profiling of primary untreated RMC tumor tissues and paired adjacent kidney controls was performed using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) and histone Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq). The expression of serum cancer antigen 125 (CA-125), was prospectively evaluated in 47 patients with RMC. Functional studies were conducted in RMC cell lines to assess the effects of SMARCB1 re-expression and MUC16 knockdown. Results: MUC16, encoding for CA-125, was identified as one of the top upregulated genes in RMC tissues, with concomitant enrichment of active histone marks H3K4me3 and H3K27ac at its promoter. Elevated serum CA-125 levels were found in 31 of 47 (66%) RMC patients and correlated significantly with metastatic tumor burden (p = 0.03). SMARCB1 re-expression significantly reduced MUC16 expression in RMC cell lines. Functional studies in RMC cell lines demonstrated that SMARCB1 re-expression significantly reduced MUC16 expression, and that MUC16 knockdown induced apoptosis and reduced cell proliferation. Conclusions: The correlation between serum CA-125 levels and metastatic burden suggests that CA-125 is a clinically relevant biomarker for RMC.

The understanding of the transcriptional changes with respect to high-risk clinical/histopathological features and outcome is poor. Here, we examine stage-matched, outcome-differentiated cSCC using whole exome and transcriptome sequencing. Exome analysis identified key driver mutations including TP53, CDKN2A, NOTCH1, SHC4, MIIP, CNOT1, C17orf66, LPHN2, and TTC16 and pathway enrichment of driver mutations in replicative senescence, cellular response to UV, cell-cell adhesion, and cell cycle. Transcriptomic analysis identified pathway enrichment of immune signaling/inflammation, cell-cycle pathways, extracellular matrix function, and chromatin function. Integrative analysis identified 183 critical genes in carcinogenesis and were used to develop a gene expression panel (GEP) for outcome. Three outcome-related gene clusters included those involved in keratinization, cell division, and metabolism.

The understanding of driving factors and critical survival genes in insulinomas is limited and overall survival is poor for canine and human malignant insulinoma. This study aimed to use single-cell RNA-sequencing to conduct a multispecies analysis of insulinoma cell lines to understand their single-cell transcriptomic landscape. Secondly, the impact of freeze-thawing on the pancreatic beta single-cell transcriptome was investigated, to determine whether cryoarchiving of primary insulinoma samples may be feasible in future studies. Methods Single-cell transcriptomic analysis was performed using fresh and cryopreserved multispecies insulinoma cell lines (canINS, CM, INS-1 and MIN6). R and Seurat were used to perform cell clustering and specific cluster marker genes were identified by the FindMarkers function. Metascape was used to identify statistically enriched pathways for specific cell clusters. Differentially expressed genes between fresh and cryopreserved single-cell transcriptome profiles, were defined as genes with a log2 fold change >0.25 and a Bonferroni-adjusted P<0.05, based on the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Results Based on the specific cell line single-cell transcriptome profiles, five or six cell clusters were constructed per cell line. All cell lines expressed neuroendocrine markers and additionally INS-1 and MIN6 displayed a gene signature indicative of mature/functional pancreatic islet/beta-cells. DEPTOR, BICC1, GHR, CCNB2, CENPA, LMO4, VANGL1, and L1CAM were identified as cross-species conserved insulinoma cluster marker genes. Little effect was found of cryopreservation and thawing on overall gene expression at the single-cell level in insulinoma cell lines: only 6 and 29 genes had a log2 fold change > 1 in cryopreserved versus fresh canINS and CM, respectively. Conclusions canINS, CM, INS-1 and MIN6 are all principally relevant as insulinoma models and the demonstrated differences in their single-cell transcriptomic profiles could aid researchers in selecting the appropriate cell lines for specific study objectives. Cross-species conserved insulinoma cluster marker genes were identified that harbour oncogenes and their involvement in insulinoma tumourigenesis should be investigated in future studies. The good comparability between cryopreserved and fresh insulinoma cells allows for inclusion of cryopreserved insulinoma patient samples in future studies, which allows for reduced assay-based variability.",GSE284573,6,24676;25947;25760;24247,40438246

Emerging evidence, however, suggests other potential origins for MCC including hematological lineages. Given the high fatality of MCCs and that many arise in the immune suppressed population, often precluding the use of immunotherapy, it is important to determine the cell of origin for these cancers to elucidate targetable pathways to enable novel treatment approaches. We utilized targeted and multi-omics approaches to explore expression patterns at both the protein and RNA level of MCCs. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry were performed for two patient-derived MCC samples, one MCC cell line, and 92 FFPE samples, respectively, for numerous B-cell markers. Further, RNA sequencing was performed on 17 FFPE patient-derived MCC samples and evaluated by principal component analysis for differentially expressed genes between samples based on sex and MCPyV status. Finally, weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and cell type enrichment analyses were employed to determine pathway and cell type enrichment, respectively. MCC patient-derived and cell line samples heterogeneously expressed B-cell and neuroendocrine markers including PAX5, TdT, IgA, CD19, CK20, and chromogranin A. Further, transcriptome analysis demonstrated differentially expressed genes based on sex and MCPyV status. MCPyV+ tumors notably demonstrated significant upregulation of genes involved in immune cell function and downregulation of processes related to neuronal activity. Finally, WGCNA highlighted enrichment for pathways involved in immune function including B-cell differentiation. Cell type enrichment analysis highlighted enrichment for multipotent stem cells, several immune cell types, and keratinocytes. Our findings together with previous results indicate that MCCs are not derived from Merkel cells and instead from multiple or divergent cell types, including those of B-cell lineage. Further, MCC cell of origin may depend on patient and tumour specific characteristics including sex and cell type/differentiation state of a cell infected by the MCPyV.

Because of its rarity, most treatments for children are adapted from adult therapies, despite possible biological differences. This study aimed to explore the molecular features of a rare and aggressive melanoma in a 16-month-old patient to understand disease progression and treatment resistance. Methods We studied the tumour and metastases of a patient with a melanoma carrying an NRAS mutation, who received chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. The patient died 10 months after diagnosis. We used DNA methylation analysis, single nucleus RNA sequencing, and deep spatial transcriptomic profiling to examine genetic changes, gene activity, and their spatial distribution in both the primary tumour and lymph node metastases. Results Here we show that the tumour displayed high genetic and transcriptomic diversity. We identified increases in MITF and BRAF gene copies as likely key drivers of the aggressive disease, which were not detected at diagnosis. We also found activation of biological pathways, including VEGFA and WNT signalling, and abnormal activity of several genes linked to immune therapy response, with marked variation between tumour regions. Conclusions This case demonstrates that paediatric melanoma can harbour complex and spatially variable molecular changes that contribute to rapid disease progression and treatment failure.

Subpopulations of TIBs have been described with diverse and even opposite roles in tumor control, based on surface molecule, cytokine and transcriptional factor expression. Furthermore, recently the predictive role of IgA and IgG expression in tumors was shown for melanoma and KRAS-mutated, but not KRAS wild type, lung adenocarcinoma. This may imply that B cells producing different immunoglobulin isotypes also acquire different functional characteristics that have unequal effects on tumor microenvironment (TME) and differentially affect tumor progression. To address this question, we performed comparative bulk transcriptome analysis of tumor-infiltrating surface-IgA+ (sIgA+) and sIgG+ memory B cells from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors. We identified FCRL4, PDCD1 and RUNX2 among genes overexpressed in IgA+ B cells, which suggests exhausted, chronically antigen-stimulated phenotype. Using public scRNA-seq data, we showed that FCRL4-expressing memory TIBs form a distinct cluster of cells with transcriptomic profile characterized by upregulation of genes involved in IFNγ and IFNα responses. sIgG+ B cells, on the other hand, overexpress IL5RA, consistent with the role of IL-5 in class-switch recombination to IgG isotype. Moreover, based on the analysis of the TCGA LUAD cohort, we found that FCRL4 to CD20 expression ratio correlates with lower overall survival, further strengthening the view on FCRL4 as a marker of exhausted dysfunctional TIBs. Our findings support the initial hypothesis that IgA/IgG ratio in tumors is not merely an indication of cytokine environment in the TME, but also reflects the difference in the functional characteristics of the respective B cell populations.",GSE287504,61,20301,NA

Experimental Design: A series of 57 melanoma cell lines (mostly short-term cultures) are analyzed for their mutation pattern based on a mutation panel of 83 genes selected from the most abundant mutations (more than 5 % of samples). Of these, 28 cell lines are treated with small molecule inhibitors either as single-agent or combination therapy. Most effective therapies are estimated by Chou Talaley method, applied to multiple drug treatments, based on growth characteristics of melanoma cells during life-cell imaging. Results: In a number of cell lines, combination treatment showed better treatment response rates than monotherapy. BRAFi and an inhibitor of a further pathway is more efficient to induce an anti-proliferative effect than the standard therapy with a BRAFi-MEKi combination. Among these are PI3K/mTOR inhibitor apitolisib either together with a BRAFi or as triple combination with BRAFi/MEKi. A combination of BRAFi and CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib also showed significant synergy. The most promising drug combinations in NRASmut cell lines is a triple combination of MEKi, ERKi and and PI3K/mTOR apitolisib, or a combination of MEKi, apitolisib and aurora A kinase inhibitor alisertib. Transcriptomic analysis showed that BRAF and NRAS mutant cell lines could be differentiated by ARHGAP42 and DLD expression, both higher expressed in BRAFmut cell lines, and ARHGAP42 being a putative new target for BRAFmut melanoma cells.

While it has long been hypothesised that such switching is triggered by external cues, the identity of these cues has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical confinement mediates phenotype switching through chromatin remodelling. Using a zebrafish model of melanoma coupled with human samples, we profiled tumour cells at the interface between the tumour and surrounding microenvironment. Morphological analysis of these rare cells showed flattened, elliptical nuclei suggestive of mechanical confinement by nearby adjacent tissue. Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics demonstrated that the interface cells adopted a gene program of neuronal invasion, including acquisition of an acetylated tubulin cage that protects the nucleus during migration. We identified the DNA-bending protein HMGB2 as a confinement-induced mediator of the neuronal state. HMGB2 is upregulated in confined cells, and quantitative modelling revealed that confinement prolongs contact time between HMGB2 and chromatin, leading to changes in chromatin configuration that favour the neuronal phenotype. Genetic disruption of HMGB2 showed that it regulates the trade-off between proliferative and invasive states, in which confined HMGB2high tumour cells are less proliferative but more drug resistant.

However, the mechanisms driving the PNI's detrimental clinical effect remain elusive. Here, we provide clinical and mechanistic insights into PNI and cancer-induced injury of tumor-associated nerves (TANs) and their role in resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Our work demonstrates that poor response to anti-PD-1 therapy in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), melanoma, and gastric cancer is associated with PNI and TANs injury. Ultrastructural electron microscopy analysis reveals that direct contact between cancer cells and nerve fibers leads to cancer-induced nerve injury (CINI) via myelin degradation.

This inflammatory response alters the immune activity in the peri-neural niche in melanoma, cSCC, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, leading to an immuno-suppressive activity aimed at nerve healing and regeneration. As the tumor grows, the CINI burden increases, the inflammatory signal within the niche becomes chronic, and eventually skews the general immune tone within the tumor microenvironment to a suppressive and exhaustive state. The CINI-driven anti-PD-1 resistance can be reversed by targeting multiple steps in the CINI signaling process: denervating the tumor, conditional knockout of the transcription factor mediating the injury signal within neurons (cKO-Atf3), knockout of the IFN-a receptor signaling (Ifnar1-/-), or by combining anti-PD-1 and anti-IL-6-receptor blockade.

Emerging evidence also suggests that MYC-driven or p53 wild-type tumors may be more sensitive to PRMT5 inhibition, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Virus-positive Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) serves as an ideal model to explore this question, as it is driven by the MYC paralog MYCL, and most virus-positive MCCs retain wild-type p53. In this study, we investigated PRMT5’s impact on the Tip60-EP400 complex, given MCC’s reliance on the interaction between MYCL and this complex.

The mechanism underlying PRMT5 deficiency's selective impact on specific splice sites while leaving others unaffected remains unclear. Our findings suggest that PRMT5-mediated methylation of SRSF1 enhances its recruitment to m6A-modified RNA, ensuring proper splicing of Tip60 and maintaining Tip60-EP400 activity. In contrast, PRMT5 inhibition disrupts this recruitment, leading to widespread splicing defects, including both exon skipping and intron retention.

NRAS-mutant tumors are aggressive and associated with poor outcomes. Although the development of targeted therapies as well as immune checkpoint inhibitors has led to a substantial improvement in the overall survival of patients with NRAS wild-type tumors, current therapies for NRAS-mutant cancers are limited. Here, analysis of RNA-sequencing data revealed a downregulation of the type I interferon response in NRAS-mutant tumors compared with NRAS wild-type tumors, which was associated with poor prognosis in NRAS-mutant melanoma. Knockdown of mutant NRAS, but not wild-type NRAS, enhanced the activation of cGAS-STING signaling. The formation of a trimeric complex between TBK1, STING, and IRF3, which is required for the activation and nuclear translocation, was blocked in NRAS-mutant tumor cells. Inactivation of innate immune signaling by mutant NRAS altered cytokine production, resulting in cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous signaling to prevent tumor cell death and in evasion of tumor immune surveillance. Screening of drugs for the ability to stimulate the release of CXCL10 revealed that SOS1 inhibitors reactivated cGAS-STING signaling in NRAS-mutant tumor cells. Importantly, combining SOS1 inhibitors with STING agonists maximized the activation of cGAS-STING signaling and elicited an increased antitumor immune response in vitro and in vivo. Overall, this study provides insights into the regulation of anti-tumor immunity by mutant NRAS and uncovers a potential strategy for treating NRAS-mutant cancer.",GSE290171,12,24676,NA

Efforts to inhibit TGFβ have been largely unsuccessful due to significant toxicity and indiscriminate immunosuppression. Leucine-rich repeat-containing protein 15 (LRRC15) is a TGFβ-regulated antigen expressed by mesenchymal-derived cancer cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). In preclinical studies, ablation of TGFβ-driven LRRC15+ CAFs increased tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells. However, the underlying pathobiological mechanisms prompting TGFβ’s upregulation of LRRC15 expression are unclear. Using an integrated approach combining functional compound screening with single-cell RNA sequencing, we reveal key genomic features regulating TGFβ’s ability to increase LRRC15 expression on cancer cells. Construction of gene regulatory networks converged our analyses on four key genes—MMP2, SPARC, TGFβR2, and WNT5B—central to TGFβ-induced LRRC15 pathobiology.

We developed a method to detect significant clusters of synonymous and missense mutations in public cancer genomics data. In melanoma, we show that 22% (11/50) of these mutation clusters are misannotated as coding mutations because the reference transcripts used for their annotation are not expressed. Instead, these mutations are actually non-coding. This, for instance, applies to the mutation clusters targeting known cancer genes kinetochore localized astrin (SPAG5) binding protein (KNSTRN) and BCL2 like 12 (BCL2L12), each affecting 4-5% of melanoma patients. For the latter, we show that these mutations are functional non-coding mutations that target the shared promoter region of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and BCL2L12 genes. This results in downregulation of IRF3, BCL2L12 and tumor protein p53 (TP53) expression in a CRISPR-Cas9 primary melanocyte model and in melanoma patients, in which these mutations are also associated to a worse response to immunotherapy. Finally, we propose a simple automated method to more accurately annotate cancer mutations based on expressed transcripts.

Here, we report the discovery of frequent genetic alterations in the desmosome in human cancers, with the strongest signal seen in cutaneous melanoma where desmosomes are mutated in >70% of cases. In primary but not metastatic melanoma biopsies, the burden of coding mutations in desmosome genes associates with a strong reduction in desmosome gene expression. Analysis by spatial transcriptomics and protein immunofluorescence suggests that these expression decreases occur in keratinocytes in the microenvironment rather than in primary melanoma cells. In further support of a microenvironmental origin, we find that desmosome gene knockdown in keratinocytes yields markedly increased proliferation of adjacent melanoma cells in keratinocyte/melanoma co-cultures. Similar increases in melanoma proliferation are observed in media preconditioned by desmosome-deficient keratinocytes. Thus, gradual accumulation of desmosome mutations in neighboring cells may prime melanoma cells for neoplastic transformation.",GSE291160,4,18573,40240879

We have previously shown that CSDE1 functions as an oncoprotein in melanoma, where it promotes invasion and metastasis, whereas it behaves as a tumour suppressor in squamous cell carcinoma, a tumor derived from keratinocytes. The reasons underlying these context-specific behaviours are unknown. To identify melanoma-specific vulnerabilities, we have compared CSDE1 protein isoforms and post-translational modifications in melanoma cells and keratinocytes, as well as in cells of different tumorigenic potential. Combining Nanopore sequencing with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and proteomics, we identify one major CSDE1 isoform expressed in melanoma cells and patient samples and find that CSDE1 phosphorylation and interactions with ribosomes represent an early event in cellular transformation, correlating with changes in the subcellular localization of CSDE1. Our data show that CSDE1 phosphorylation promotes de novo interactions of CSDE1 with ribosomes, uncovering a specific vulnerability of melanoma cells that might be harnessed for therapeutic intervention.",GSE292019,4,24106;24973,40883018

Surprisingly, in both subtypes the neuroendocrine cells are largely non-proliferative while higher proliferation is observed in multiple non-malignant cell types. Specifically, B and plasma cells are highly proliferative in the epithelial-like SiNET subtype, potentially reflecting the outcome of high Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) expression in those tumors, which may constitute a relevant target. Finally, our analysis of a mixed lung neuroendocrine tumor identifies a population of putative progenitor cells that may give rise to both neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine (squamous) cells, potentially explaining the origin of the mixed histology.

Based on our selected patient cohort, we examined for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and key-pathways that appear preferentially activated in stage III vs. IV melanoma, and in long vs. short immunotherapy responders.Results: Although circulating immune-cells did not numerically differ in both sets of analysis(staging and ICI responsiveness), DEA and GO data showed that patients could be clustered separately, identifying 189vs.92 DEGs in stage IV/III and 101vs.47 DEGs in early progressors/long responders. These DEGs were functionally implicated in distinct pathways. For metastatic cases: inflammatory response (log p-value=-9.2: ADGRE5/2,CYBA,GRN,HMOX1,IRF5,ITGAM), adaptive immunity(log p-value=-7.7: CD1C,CD74,CYBB,NCF2,CTSA,S100A8/9,BCL3,FCER1G), T-cell activation(log p-value=-6.3: BCL3,CD1C,CD74,FCER1G,FGL2)and lipid metabolism/catabolism(log p-value=-2.5/-2.6: ARF3,GPX1,MVD,OCRL,PCCB,CTSA,PNPLA2,NAGLU,GBA2,ABHD4); while in early- progressors to ICIs: immune effector processing(log p-value=-13.7: BCL6,FGR,HLA-DQA1/DQB1,HLA-DRA,HLA- DRB1/DRB5,NKG7,SLC11A1,TYROBP,SPON2,HAVCR2),PD-1(log p-value=-10.2: HLA-DQA1/DQB1,HLA-DRA,HLA-DRB1/DRB5)and IFN signaling(logp-value=-8.5: HLA-DQA1/DQB1,HLA-DRA,HLA-DRB1/DRB5,NCAM1,IFITM3),positive regulation of T-cell activation(log p- value=-7.7: BCL6,HLA-DQA1/DQB1,HLA-DRA,HLA-DRB1/DRB5,SASH3,HAVCR2)and CD28 co-stimulation(log p-value=-10.3: HLA- DQA1/DQB1,HLA-DRA,HLA-DRB1/DRB5), supporting an immune-mediated behavior. Conclusions: Specific pathways and marker genes in the peripheral CD4+T-cells may predetermine melanoma staging and immunotherapy resistance.",GSE292798,24,21697,40226614

Little is known about the transcriptional programs that account for the morphological and biological differences in HV tumors. To investigate the tumor biology of HV bladder cancers, we generated a single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas of nine HV tumors and three UC tumors. Our analyses revealed a tumor cell state specific to HVs that is characterized by expression of MUC16 (CA125), KRT24, and WISP2. This CA125+ cell state bears transcriptional hallmarks of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, is enriched in metastases, is predicted to be highly chemotherapy resistant, and is linked with poor survival, suggesting that this cell state plays an important role in the aggressive biology of HV tumors. Our analyses also provide evidence of transcriptional “mimicry” between HVs and histologically similar non-urothelial cell types. Lastly, we identified higher expression of TM4SF1, a cell surface protein associated with cancer metastasis, in HV tumor cells compared to UC tumor cells. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells engineered against TM4SF1 protein demonstrated in vitro and in vivo activity against bladder cancer cell lines in a TM4SF1 expression-dependent manner, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target in bladder cancer.",GSE293189,67,34281,40527915

Expression levels of nine biomarkers—ESR1, PGR, AR, MKI67, ERBB2, CD274, CDX2, KRT7, and KRT20—were analyzed in 365 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples from breast, lung, gastrointestinal, and other solid carcinomas. Correlations between RNA-seq data and IHC scores were determined using Spearman’s correlation coefficients, with RNA-seq cut-offs established to distinguish positive from negative IHC scores. The results revealed strong correlations for most biomarkers, with coefficients ranging from 0.53 to 0.89. RNA-seq thresholds were confirmed across internal and external cohorts, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy (up to 98%) and precision in identifying biomarker expression levels. The analysis also highlighted the influence of tumor microenvironment and purity, particularly in the moderate correlation 0.63 observed for PD-L1. Our study demonstrates that RNA-seq can serve as a robust complementary tool to IHC, offering objective and high-throughput biomarker assessment.

We conducted a large epigenetic compound library screen with the currently most well characterized, focused epigenetics library available, which consists of 932 potent, cell permeable, medically active, epigenetic-directed small molecule modulators. Our screening identified two new lead compounds, which so-far have been unappreciated for UM. Romidepsin, an HDAC inhibitor with specificity for class I HDACs, was the most efficient compound in-vitro, as well as the BET inhibitor Mivebresib, which showed minimal toxicity on normal cells. RNA sequencing and pathway analysis revealed an upregulation of PRC-associated gene targets induced by HDAC inhibition, while BET inhibition appears to act through retinoic acid related pathways. Mivebresib treatment in a metastatic uveal melanoma mouse model resulted in longer survival times and reduced metastasis to the spinal cord and brain. The results of our drug screen indicate a vulnerability for HDAC and BET inhibition for UM cells.

Circulating biomarkers have the potential to identify patients with primary resistance or early progression on therapy to alter treatment course and avoid unnecessary toxicity. Unbiased multimodal proteomic profiling in blood has been underexplored due to the previously limited scalability of multiplexing technologies or cohorts lacking time-series sampling. To address this, we performed plasma proteomic profiling of >2,900 proteins and high-dimensional mass cytometry of peripheral blood lymphocytes across serial time points in 250 metastatic melanoma patients on ICB treatment. We further obtained 92 patient-matched tumor samples, which were processed for single-cell and/or bulk RNA sequencing. Proteins upregulated post-ICB were associated with inflammatory pathways involving the activation of effector immune functions. Expression of genes corresponding to these proteins was higher in immune cells involved in recruitment and tumor reactivity. Expression of genes corresponding to plasma proteins more abundant in non-responders was highest in suppressive myeloid subsets and malignant cells. We further posit the involvement of these non-responder genes in immunosuppressive and pro-tumor interactions, which we confirmed using publicly available spatial transcriptomic data. We also found that epithelial-specific proteins in the circulation of responders post-ICB correlate with patient toxicity and likely originate from healthy tissues. Together, these data represent one of the deepest peripheral biomarker studies using paired blood and tumor samples in melanoma patients treated with ICB, and begin to elucidate the complex interplay between tumors and the systemic immune response within the host.",GSE295942,83,16791,NA

The lysine methyltransferase SETD6 has been implicated in regulating transcription, cell adhesion, migration, and other processes in various cancers, however its role in melanoma remains unexplored. We recently reported that SETD6 mono-methylates the BRD4 at K99 to selectively regulate transcription of genes involved in mRNA translation. Here, we observed that BRD4 methylation at K99 by SETD6 occurs in melanoma cells. Knockout of SETD6 or a point mutation at BRD4-K99 disrupts BRD4 genomic occupancy. In addition, we show that SETD6 interacts with MITF, a master transcription factor in melanocytes and melanoma, and influences the genomic distribution of MITF. Mechanistically, we uncover a novel chromatin- localized interaction between BRD4 and MITF in melanoma. Our data suggest that BRD4 binds MITF in melanoma cells and that this interaction is dependent on both SETD6-mediated methylation of BRD4 and MITF acetylation. This chromatin complex plays a pivotal role in selective recruitment of BRD4 and MITF to different genomic loci in melanoma cells.",GSE298160,6,34281,40809945

However, resistance frequently emerges, limiting its long-term effectiveness and highlighting the need for combination therapies. This study aimed to identify synergistic drug combinations to overcome vemurafenib resistance in BRAF-mutant melanoma using an integrative computational approach. We applied a modified version of SynGeNet, which combines gene expression data with protein–protein interaction networks, to predict effective drug combinations in the vemurafenib-resistant A375 melanoma cell line. The analysis identified sorafenib and pioglitazone as the most promising candidates. Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting signaling pathways involved in proliferation and angiogenesis, while pioglitazone activates PPARγ and modulates stress responses. Transcriptomic profiling of resistant cells revealed enrichment in nucleotide metabolism, protein trafficking, and corticosteroid response pathways, alongside suppression of mitotic and cell cycle processes. In vitro validation confirmed that the sorafenib/pioglitazone combination reduces cell viability with a strong synergistic effect.

Metastatic UM remains highly resistant to therapy and is almost invariably fatal. The strongest genetic driver of UM metastasis is loss of function of the tumor suppressor BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1), which leads to widespread epigenetic dysregulation. To identify novel therapeutic strategies, we investigated whether targeting the epigenome could reveal new vulnerabilities in UM. We performed high-throughput compound screening using a curated epigenetic inhibitor library and identified BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal domain) inhibition as a particularly promising approach. While previous clinical trials with BET inhibitors for UM treatment have failed clinically, we found substantial heterogeneity in the efficacy of different BET inhibitors in UM. Notably, the BET inhibitor mivebresib (ABBV-075) significantly improved survival rates by 50% in a metastatic UM xenograft mouse model and prevented detectable metastases in the bones, spinal cord, and brain. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a strong overlap between BET inhibition and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition-- an approach currently under clinical evaluation for UM treatment. BET and HDAC inhibitors reversed gene expression signatures associated with high metastatic risk and induced a neuron-like phenotype in UM cells.

Since carcinoids have low expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP), we hypothesized that low YAP expression provides a molecular advantage to carcinoids by preventing YAP from binding its partner, TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD). To test this hypothesis, we overexpressed constitutively active YAP and a TEAD-binding defective form of YAP in lung (H727) and pancreatic (BON1) carcinoid cells. We found that active YAP overexpression inhibited neuroendocrine markers, morphology, cell proliferation and anchorage-independent cell growth, while TEAD-binding defective YAP recovered these features. Through integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses, we found that YAP-TEAD binding downregulated neuroendocrine transcription factor genes and upregulated transforming growth factor (TGFβ) and Notch genes related to cell growth. We conclude that low YAP expression permits neuroendocrine differentiation and growth in carcinoid cells by preventing YAP-TEAD binding and subsequent dysregulation of neuroendocrine transcription factors, TGFβ and Notch gene targets.

Risk prediction based on the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging system has medium accuracy with intermediate IIB-IIIB stages, as roughly 25% of patients with low-medium-grade TNM, and hence a favorable prognostic, undergo an aggressive disease with short survival and around 15% of deaths arise from metastases of thin, low-risk lesions. Therefore, reliable prognostic biomarkers are required. We used genomic and clinical information of melanoma patients from the TCGA-SKCM cohort and two GEO studies for discovery and validation of potential biomarkers, respectively. Neither mutation nor overexpression of major melanoma driver genes provided significant prognostic information. Conversely, expression of MGRN1 and the melanocyte-specific genes MLANA, PMEL, and TYRP1 provided a simple 4-gene signature identifying with high-sensitivity (>80%), low-medium TNM patients with adverse outcomes. Transcriptomic analysis of tumors with this signature, or from low-medium-grade TNM patients with poor outcomes, revealed comparable dysregulation of an inflammatory response, cell cycle progression, and DNA damage/repair programs. A functional analysis of MGRN1- knockout cells confirmed these molecular features. Therefore, the simple MGRN1-MLANAPMEL- TYRP1 combination of biomarkers complemented TNM staging prognostic accuracy and pointed to the dysregulation of immunological responses and genomic stability as determinants of a melanoma outcome.",GSE305457,8,16791,40004203

It has been previously shown that, a mutation within CDK11 (G579S) confers resistance to CDK11 inhibition. To further understand the role of CDK11 in cancer, we performed RNA-sequencing in four cancer cell lines (A375, Cal51, DLD1 and MDA-MB-231 cells) in both wild-type and G579S background. Here, we report that treatment with CDK11 inhibitor OTS964 results in a notable increase in intron retention. The expression of CDK11-G579S rescues the abberent splicing in the presence of CDK11 inhibitior, OTS964. GSEA analysis of the transcripts with retained introns have roles in gene expression, splicing and cell cycle progression. In addition to splicing related genes, we also revealed that CDK11 inhibition results in a significant downregulaiton of genes associated with DNA repair. This was an on-target effect of OTS964 treatment as this downregulation was not observed in cells expressing CDK11-G579S.

To investigate regulatory roles of ZNF180 to confer these immune suppressive phenotypes, we performed ZNF180 knock-down in melanoma cells in vitro with different genetic backgrounds, namely A375 (BRAF-mutant) and SKMEL147 (NRAS-mutant) cells, and performed RNA- and ATAC-sequencing. The integrative analysis revealed ZNF180 silencing promoted tumor immunogenicity through gain of accessibility on MHC-I/-II coding genes, CD155 down-regulation to avoid TIGIT/CD155 checkpoint signaling, and suppressed AP-1 transcription factor activities as the drivers of melanoma reprogramming towards MITFlowAXLhigh de-differentiated cells. Further, ZNF180 silencing increased CD4 helper T-cell infiltrations in tumors and regressed the tumors in vivo. Collectively, these results indicate ZNF180 is a tumor intrinsic regulator of melanoma plasticity to drive de-differentiated phenotypes with immune-suppressive features including loss of immunogenicity, T-cell inhibitory signals through TIGIT/CD155 checkpoint and exclusion of CD4 helper T-cells. As ZNF180-regulome manifests in non-metastatic melanoma in contrast to the current focus of standard-of-care ICI on the metastatic disease, these results establish ZNF180-regulome as a biomarker and novel therapeutic avenue for early stage melanoma to intervene ICI resistance.",GSE307748,12,24676,NA

Beyond its metabolic role, NAMPT also exerts immune-modulatory functions, acting as a cytokine-like mediator that shapes tumor–host interactions and influences the efficacy of immunotherapy. Building on recent evidence indicating a connection between the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) signaling and NAD metabolism, we sought to explore this poorly understood relationship in melanoma context. Analysis of the TCGA melanoma cohort revealed a significant correlation between NAMPT expression and IFN-γ signaling, including specific genes belonging to this pathway, such as IRF1, STAT1, and CD274/PD-L1. The correlation between NAMPT and PD-L1 was also confirmed at the protein level in more than 100 cases included in a melanoma tissue microarray (TMA). Functionally, IFN-γ treatment (100ng/ml for 24h) of three MM cell lines led to increased NAMPT transcription and intracellular expression, as well as increased release. Molecularly, as previously demonstrated for IFN-γ-inducible PD-L1, also NAMPT expression upon IFN-γ signaling activation is regulated at epigenetic/transcriptional level via bromodomain protein BRD4/IRF1 complex, as revealed using BRD4 inhibitors and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-RT-PCR experiments. In the second part of our results, we showed a bidirectional regulation between NAD/NAMPT axis and IFN-γ signaling. NAMPT inhibition, as well as genetic silencing, reduced IFN-γ signaling activation, as highlighted by RNAseq data and confirmed by biochemical validation. This reciprocal regulation involved the modulation of mitochondrial respiration, specifically mitochondrial Complex I. Analysis of the melanoma TCGA cohort revealed a significant correlation between NAMPT expression, IFN signaling and several mitochondrial Complex I subunit genes. Consistently, activation of IFN-γ signaling in melanoma cell lines induced an increase in oxygen consumption rate, which was completely abrogated by NAD/NAMPT-dependent inhibition of complex I activity, indicating a direct metabolic crosstalk.",GSE310354,9,34284,NA

Using high-throughput drug screening of clonally-derived resistant clones with varying transcriptomes and morphologies, we show that each clone had a distinct drug sensitivity profile. These results suggested that there are drugs that are effective against only subsets of resistant populations but in combination eliminate a large proportion of the resistant population.

MCPyV ST dynamically alters the cellular transcriptome with increased levels of glycolytic genes, including the monocarboxylate lactate transporter SLC16A1 (MCT1). Extracellular flux analysis revealed increased lactate export reflecting elevated aerobic glycolysis in ST expressing cells. Inhibition of MCT1 activity suppressed the growth of MCC cell lines and impaired MCPyV-dependent transformation of IMR90 cells. Both NF-κB and MYC have been shown to regulate MCT1 expression. While MYC was required for MCT1 induction, MCPyV-induced MCT1 levels decreased following knockdown of the NF-κB subunit RelA, supporting a synergistic activity between MCPyV and MYC in regulating MCT1 levels. Several MCC lines had high levels of MYCL and MYCN but not MYC. Increased levels of MYCL was more effective than MYC or MYCN in increasing extracellular acidification in MCC cells. Our results demonstrate the effects of MCPyV ST on the cellular transcriptome and reveal that transformation is dependent, at least in part, on elevated aerobic glycolysis.",GSE79968,78,11154,27880818

Such methods can cause loss of coverage at the 5’ end of genes, impacting the ability to detect fusions when used on degraded samples. The goal of this study was to quantify the effects RNA degradation has on fusion detection when using poly-A selected mRNA and to identify the variables involved in this process Methods: Total RNA was extracted from solid tumor tissue and whole blood using the Qiagen® miRNeasy Micro and Mini kits, respectively. The KU812 cell line was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and UHR (Universal Human Reference RNA) was purchased from Agilent (Santa Clara, CA). UHR is a mixture of cell lines derived from breast adenocarcinoma, hepatoblastoma, cervix adenocarcinoma, testis embryonal carcinoma, gliobastoma, melanoma, liposarcoma, histiocytic lymphoma, lymphoblastic leukemia and plasmocytoma. For Degradation experiments, two micrograms of human universal reference RNA (UHR) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and 1ug of RNA extracted from KU812 cell line (purchased from ATCC) were degraded at 74oC from 1 to 11 minutes in 1 minute intervals, using the NEBNext® Magnesium RNA Fragmentation Module Kit (NEB, Ipswich, MA). RNA was then purified and concentrated with RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Results: In this study, we designed experiments using artificially degraded RNA from cell lines as well as naturally degraded RNA from tissue samples to quantify the effect RNA degradation has on fusion detection when using poly-A selected RNA libraries We found that both the RNA degradation level and the distance from the 3’ end of a gene, negatively impact the read coverage profile in RNA-seq. Furthermore, the median transcript coverage decreases exponentially as a function of the distance from the 3’ end and there is a linear relationship between the coverage decay rate and the RNA integrity number (RIN). Conclusions: we found that when using poly-A pulldown techniques for library preparation in RNA-seq, the fusion sensitivity is negatively impacted by both sample degradation and distance of the fusion breakpoint from the 3’ end and developed graphs that show such effect. Such graphs can be useful in assessing the fusion sensitivity of RNA-seq in both research and clinical settings",GSE80126,29,16791,27765019

The tumor microenvironment is abundant with exosomes secreted by the cancer cells themselves. Studies have shown that tumor-derived exosomes can transport RNA and active molecules to other cells to promote tumor growth. Exosomes are increasingly being recognized as a major contributor in the progression of malignant neoplasms. We have found that normal melanocytes can acquire invasiveness through the internalization of melanoma cell-derived exosomes. However, little is known about how the exosomes modulate the melanocytes in the microenvironment to optimize conditions for tumor progression and metastasis. We hypothesize that melanoma cell-derived exosomes can drive the dysregulation of transcriptomes in normal melanocytes and facilitate melanoma progression. Our objective is to identify differentially expressed genes in melanocytes driven by tumor cell-derived exosomes through RNA sequencing and translate those genes as therapeutic targets for melanoma metastasis.",GSE84683,9,18573,31678172

However, resistance to these targeted therapies invariably develops and limits their clinical efficacy. Targeting tumours with kinase inhibitors induces complex adaptive survival programs that promote the persistence of a fraction of the original cancer cell population, facilitating the eventual outgrowth of inhibitor-resistant tumour clones following clonal evolution. Here we show that the addition of a newly identified transcriptional repressor, THZ1, to targeted cancer therapy enhances cell killing and impedes the emergence of drug-resistant cell populations in cellular and in vivo cancer models with diverse genetic dependencies. We propose that targeted therapy induces a state of transcriptional dependency in a subpopulation of cells poised to become drug tolerant. THZ1 can exploit this dependency by blocking dynamic transcriptional responses, remodelling of enhancers and key signalling outputs required for tumour cell survival in the setting of targeted cancer therapies. These findings suggest that the addition of THZ1 to targeted cancer therapies is a promising broad-based strategy to hinder the emergence of drug-resistant cancer cell populations.",GSE89127,90,11154,29054992
